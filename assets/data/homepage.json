The sauce is so flavorful and I love how roasty the chicken skin got. This is a must make recipe!!!",

        "description": "Our better-than-ever broccoli cheddar soup recipe is lighter and brighter than some you may have had in the past. It boasts a creaminess that comes from blended potatoes and broccoli stalks rather than heavy cream or the roux that many recipes call for—which means that, minus the optional garnish, this creamy soup is also gluten-free. Grating a block of sharp cheddar is crucial for this comfort food classic as the preshredded stuff is often mixed with an anti-caking agent that can wreak havoc with the silky texture of this delicious soup.\r\nThe other main player in broccoli cheese soup is, of course, the green stuff. The broccoli florets play two roles in this recipe: Half are added to the puréed base lending it a verdant hue, while the rest are mixed in toward the end, offering a nice crunch to break up the richness. Finally, in a nod to crusty bread bowls, we’ve added cheddar-topped croutons to every serving.\r\nFor a dairy-free broccoli soup, check out Andy Baraghani’s recipe with turmeric, peanuts, and crispy shallots or Hetty McKinnon’s broccoli and cashew number for a cream of broccoli soup experience that is completely vegan.",

Some blender advice: Don't fill your blender more than halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center lid from the blender and cover with a kitchen towel. Alternatively, use an immersion blender. Your soup won’t be quite as smooth, but it will still be great. Return purée to pot.",
          "Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot and cook until bright green, another 3–5 minutes. Add 2 cups cheddar cheese and stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to low; set aside while you make the cheddar croutons.",
          "Heat broiler. Broil 4 thick slices rustic white bread (if using) on a rimmed baking sheet until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread over (soft side up), then sprinkle with reserved cheddar cheese and a few flecks of red pepper flakes. Continue to broil until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 2–3 more minutes.",
          "Remove soup from heat and stir in ½ cup plain Greek yogurt. Season generously with black pepper; taste for salt.",

        "description": "Potlikker (or “pot liquor”) is the brothy, nutrient-dense liquid gold traditionally left behind after boiling greens and beans. An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of powerful flavor. In this herbaceous version, Hall doubles down on the fennel’s licorice notes by adding a glug of Pernod, an anise-based liqueur that’s a natural pairing with seafood and vegetables.\r\nUse this potlikker as a base for Hall’s Shrimp and Grits With Fennel Potlikker, her Lemony Spring Vegetable and Barley Bowl, or any dish that would benefit from an intensely aromatic broth.",

It’s important to buy pearl barley for this recipe: Compared to whole grain hulled barley, which is chewy and requires lots of cooking liquid, the pearl barley used here cooks in less time and results in a creamier texture (think arborio rice). Another quick-cooking grain like pearled farro would also work well here. Making Hall’s Fennel Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.",

The steak should be pretty rare when you shingle it over the vegetables, but don’t worry: After a few minutes under the broiler, it will be perfectly cooked.",

But when you simmer a whole head of cauliflower with onion, garlic, and half-and-half, then blend it all until thick and velvety, it makes a sublime creamy cauliflower soup that’s all the more remarkable because it's so quick to prepare. Half-and-half adds just the right amount of rich dairy flavor to help the cauliflower taste its best, but you could also use milk, heavy cream (or mix equal parts of both for DIY half-and-half), or plant-based milk. Don’t skip the white pepper or the fresh lemon juice—they’re the secret ingredients that’ll have you craving spoonful after spoonful. The cheesy mustard croutons on top offer an ideal mix of sharp and rich flavors, but this creamy soup would also be delicious topped with toasted sunflower seeds, a spoonful of chili crisp, or some pesto.",

Add 1 medium onion, chopped, and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if onion starts to brown, until softened but without taking on any color, 5–7 minutes. Add 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add 1 large head of cauliflower (2½–3 lb.), florets broken into small pieces, core chopped, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, ¼ tsp. freshly ground white or black pepper, and 5½ cups water (the water should just barely cover the cauliflower). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until cauliflower is completely tender and starting to fall apart, 15–20 minutes. Stir in ¾ cup half-and-half and simmer 5 minutes; remove from heat.",
          "While the soup is simmering, whisk 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, and 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt and pepper. Add 5 cups country-style bread, preferably day-old, torn or sliced into 1\" cubes, and toss to coat in mustard mixture. Scatter ½ cup finely grated Gruyère or cheddar over and toss again to combine. Transfer bread mixture to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake in a single layer, turning halfway through, until cheese is melted and croutons are golden brown and crisp, 10–15 minutes.",
          "Working in batches, carefully purée soup in a blender until very smooth, transferring to a medium bowl as you go. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender to blend soup in pot until smooth.) Return soup to pot and reheat over medium-low, stirring and adding more water to thin if needed (you’re going for the consistency of heavy cream). Stir in 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. fresh lemon juice. Taste and season soup with more salt and/or pepper if desired.",

When simmered in butter and miso, delicate hakurei turnips turn tender and sweet, providing a perfect contrast to their peppery greens. Building on Hall’s Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker, this brothy pasta is hearty and warming without being too heavy. Making the Smoked Paprika and Sun-Dried Tomato Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.",

I would think any large turnip would also work, if cut to smaller pieces. Only wish was that I had also gotten a good loaf of crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce. Leftovers were great the next day as well. We'll be making this again!",

Here I landed on a mix of dried shiitake mushrooms, kombu (dried kelp), and miso to bring a nuanced complexity to the broth. (Read more about how I developed the recipe here.)",

It was also, I thought, quite an expensive recipe (shiitake mushrooms, kombu), at least where I live, for very little payoff. I wouldn't make it again. ",

Increase heat to medium-high and add 1 medium onion, quartered, 1 medium carrot, scrubbed, coarsely chopped, 2 medium celery stalks, coarsely chopped, and one 2\" piece ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are starting to char in places and browned bits form on bottom of pot, 8–10 minutes.",

        "description": "Beef and daikon are a classic pairing in Asian soups. Daikon brings a pleasant sweetness to the broth—it’s so juicy and soft when done right—while beef contributes richness and depth. To make this soup, you’ll start with bone-in short ribs, separating the meat from the bones and browning both with aromatics to build deep caramelized flavor. Then you’ll deglaze the pot with rice wine and cook everything down with added spices. The end result is a comforting soup brimming with cubes of fall-apart beef and super tender daikon that will get you through the last leg of winter.",

        "description": "Moussaka might be the most famous Greek casserole, but it certainly isn’t the only one. Similar to Greek moussaka, pastitsio starts out with layers of spiced meat and gets finished with creamy, cheesy béchamel sauce before getting baked. Pastitsio, however, uses pasta, specifically the titular extra-large hollow noodles sometimes referred to as Greek macaroni (we love Loi brand). Bucatini will work in a pinch, as will Romano cheese subbed in for the salty, fragrant Greek cheese kasseri, which you can find at specialty markets.",

Cook 2 finely chopped large red onions, 4 thinly sliced garlic cloves, and 2 lb. ground beef, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and beef is browned, 10–15 minutes.",
          "Add 2 bay leaves, 3 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste, 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, ¾ tsp. ground cumin, ¾ tsp. ground cinnamon, and ¼ tsp. ground cloves to pot; season with freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring often, until tomato paste and spices are evenly distributed, about 4 minutes. Add ¾ cup red wine, scraping up any browned bits, and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes and 2 cups low-sodium beef broth and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick and meaty (most of the liquid should have cooked off), 45–60 minutes. Taste and season with salt. Let cool until almost room temperature, about 30 minutes.",

Add egg whites to noodles and toss to coat (this will help the noodles form a sliceable layer in the final dish). Arrange noodles in straight lines, all facing the same direction, as best you can.",
          "Melt 5 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 5 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and whisk until flour is combined and mixture is light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Add 3 cups room-temperature milk in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, until thick enough to coat a spoon, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in 5 oz. finely grated kasseri or Romano cheese. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper (be sure to taste after whisking in the cheese; depending on the kind of cheese you use, you may not need to add any salt). Beat reserved egg yolks to blend, then whisk into béchamel.",
          "Spoon meat sauce over noodles in baking dish, then top with béchamel, smoothing into an even layer. Sprinkle remaining 2 oz. finely grated kasseri or Romano cheese on top. Bake pastitsio until starting to brown around the edges and top is set (it will still be a little jiggly, but will continue to firm up as it cools), 35–40 minutes.",

        "description": "This comforting hot pot base gets plenty of umami from mushrooms and alliums, which means there’s no need for meat. Chef Eric Sze of New York City’s 886 and wenwen likes pairing a mild, refreshing broth like this one with a spicier broth in a divided pot because switching between the two “makes your palate dance,” Sze explains. If you want to spice up this broth, however, you can add 4 Tbsp. Pixian chili bean paste and 15 dried chao tian jiao (or dried chiles de árbol) and cook for 2 minutes before adding the onions. Even if you aren’t making hot pot, you can use this broth as a flavorful (and vegan!) base for stews, soups, braises—or just something comforting to sip on.",

Preserved lemon, a pantry superstar if there ever was one, adds a brightness that cuts through the rich, stewy lentils. Because preserved lemons can vary in salt and acidity depending on the brand, you’ll want to adjust the amount of salt and lemon accordingly. As for the herbs, dill and basil work especially well in this soup, but you can use any tender herbs you have on hand. And if the toppers feel too involved for a Wednesday night (I get it!), feel free to spoon over a bit of your favorite store-bought chili crisp instead. ",

I made it almost as written, except double the garlic (duh), and made it in my instant pot (15 high pressure then natural release). I felt like the amount of preserved lemon was just right, not overpowering. Finished with chopped cilantro. Would be good with a dollop of Greek yogurt. ",

Your website and videos are wonderful tools, but please, please fix the print capability. For environmental reasons alone, the recipes need to be reduced to fit on only the space they need and actually print–stripping out advertisements, pictures, videos, etc. This is done by other food websites so I know it can technically be done. I'm not the only avid supporter of your magazine who has expressed this opinion.

I didn't find the garlic chips necessary, but really loved the Chilli oil and would double that next time. I only had dill so added some chopped green onion which was great! I'd would also consider mint as an alternative. My biggest gripe was it was a bit too watery and I would probably reduce the stock to 6 cups next time. ",

If anyone cares about their health, and I would think that people making these good recipes would be amount those people, it’s well known in food science that extra virgin olive oil makes free radicals which are not good for us when heated. Lighter olive oil is what we should cook with, saving extra virgin olive oil only for dipping and finishing off a dish that’s finished cooking, to add a little flavor. I’ve seen this knowledge repeated by Italian cooks on food shows where they are in Italy, so it’s not just American food science that has published this for quite some time now. Cook with light olive oil for your heath. Save your extra virgin for dressings and dipping. ",

I find the comment on 7/11/20 to be ignorant and an unfortunate example of how the noble intention to be inclusive can be warped into painful extremism. As a woman of color, I am repulsed by the thought that only people of a certain culture/ethnicity can be the voice for that culture, as if only Vietnamese people are ever allowed to present an \"authentic\" pho recipe - for example. Or that only an Indian staff-person at BA is allowed to present any Indian recipe. The maple syrup used in this recipe is obviously not traditional, but if one tries the substitution, one may find the flavor to be softer and richer than using palm or cane sugar.",

By starting the curd on the stovetop, you’ll ensure that it sets quickly when transferred to the oven, which will keep its texture soft yet sliceable. The secret ingredient—okay, it’s cream of tartar—provides a sour counterpoint that keeps these from being cloyingly sweet, and the buttery vanilla shortbread offers just enough heft to anchor the curd while still keeping the bars melt-in-your-mouth tender.",

Buttery crunchy crust, and I used 100% frozen passionfruit (Whole Foods sells in thee frozen fruit section ), as opposed to juice which is sometimes diluted with other juices, losing tartness. I wasn't sure why flour was used in the curd. I've made curd without it and it's perfect. Some small flour lumps remained which is possibly why this recipe calls for putting the curd through a sieve. This part added on much more time/work. If I make these again, I'm skipping the flour and saving the time, and I'm guessing they'll be just as good. Cant wait to serve them to end my dinner party this Sat! Thank you.",

Preserved lemons, when puréed into paste and incorporated into the simple batter, bring a powerful citrus flavor and subtle brininess that zest and juice alone could never achieve. Olive oil reinforces the fruity savoriness and works with the sour cream to keep this loaf plush and moist for days. (And before you worry, even though preserved lemons are salt-cured, the final product does not taste salty.)",

Add sour cream and mix to combine. Add preserved-lemon paste, lemon zest, and lemon juice and mix to combine. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and mix until just combined, about 15 seconds. (Batter can also be mixed together in a large bowl with a whisk.) Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top.",

If you have an old oven like me, then you'll also need to increase the cooking temperature (325 F is just waaaay too low) . A big tip to know when it's done: if you see that the top is starting to change color (to a golden brown) take it out immediately! If you see bubbles then you might have over cooked it, it will develop a skin on the bottom that is not pleasant to eat (but the rest of the cake is still okay-just not ideal). I've made this a few times. Another tip while making the caramel, if you add more than 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, then flan will have more of a lemon drop flavor (which isn't bad, but it over-powers the coffee flavor). You could do a lemon-flavored flan with this method without the coffee beans. The flan will always have a dull gray-ish color to it, hence the coffee beans, (which is not typical for flans) but I don't think it takes away from the texture or flavor. It just looks unusual for this dish.",

Cook lemon juice, remaining ⅔ cup sugar, and ¼ cup water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Do not rush this step; if liquid boils before sugar dissolves, the caramel will never darken. Once syrup turns clear, stop stirring and increase heat to medium. Cook, swirling pan every few minutes, until caramel is deep mahogany and wisps of smoke appear. Immediately pour into pie dish. Quickly tilt pan to coat bottom and a bit of the way up the sides with caramel. Set inside a roasting pan or other ovenproof dish with high sides.",

Bake until custard is set but still jiggles a bit at the very center, about 1½ hours. Let cool in water bath 30 minutes.

Gluten-free and packed with protein, chickpea flour pancakes come in many variations across the world, from Indian besan chilla to French socca to Italian farinata. If you don’t feel like or have time to make pancake batter during your lunch break (though we highly recommend it!) large flour or alt-flour tortillas work wonderfully as a substitute; just fold the cooked greens and cheese inside the tortillas and heat directly in the skillet to melt the cheese.",

At its core, it’s just tequila and Squirt [grapefruit soda]. That’s it. And that’s what makes it so great.” It’s rare to find a paloma listed on a bar menu in Mexico. They are simply part of relaxed social gatherings, where you set out tequila bottles on a table along with Squirt (and maybe an alternative of Topo Chico mineral water and a few limes to make a Ranch Water) for self-service. “When I want a paloma, I like that exact bracing taste and the sugar rush to go with the bold taste of tequila. Nothing compares.” There is nothing precious about pouring up a Squirt and tequila. It’s the equivalent of a basic rum and Coke.",

        "description": "It’s hard to resist the lure of crispy anything. Here, quick-cooking fillets of fish are slathered in a deeply flavorful combination of miso, butter, and panko, then broiled until the breadcrumbs form a toasty, golden crust. My days as a line cook at Perry St restaurant in New York inspired the technique behind this dish. It was my first job out of culinary school, and in the winter we’d make a similar dish using roast cod topped with a thin sheet of truffle butter reinforced with panko. This is an easier, far more accessible version that’s just as tasty. I use my preferred technique of cooking fish with the skin on (it holds the flesh together as it cooks) yet with no intention of getting it crispy—I just lift the fish away from the skin when it’s time to serve. I find that chasing crispy fish skin is a heartbreaking pursuit, so I don’t even bother. Besides, you won’t miss it with all the texture from the buttery panko business on top. ",

The end result was delicious and different from anything I usually make. I didn’t find the flavour overpowering at all, I think in part because I used light miso, which is milder. I cooked the salmon for a bare 15 minutes and only had to broil for a minute and a half to brown the panko. Salmon was lovely; I think it helped that I got it to room temperature before cooking.",

We double the recipe so we can have leftovers too!! Just do the pork in separate batches. Tonight we did it with spaghetti squash as the base and it added a great texture plus extra veggies!

        "description": "The key to an excellent whiskey sour? Getting the balance just right. This whiskey sour recipe has all the right proportions of bright, bracing lemon juice; warming, floral bourbon; and sweet simple syrup to deliver a refreshing cocktail that’s neither too cloying nor too biting. Using freshly squeezed juice is essential—the stuff that comes out of fruit-shaped squeeze bottles doesn’t even compare. If you don't have any lemon on hand, you can swap it out for lime (or a mixture of the two). Serve on the rocks with an orange wheel and a Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear (optional but recommended!), and enjoy. Cheers!",

The buns did bake much faster than 50 min though. Tops were fully brown after around 25 min, so I added foil over top. Pulled the buns out around 40-42 min and internal temp at the very center was over 200. So I'd suggest checking the internal temp more frequently the first time you make these.",

          "Fill a large stock pot two-thirds full with water and heat over high to bring to a boil. Once you see the water start to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt. We know, we know: That looks like a LOT of salt. But salting the pasta water aggressively—it should almost be seawater-salty—is the key to making sure that every noodle is properly seasoned through and through, and is one reason why restaurant pasta tastes better than the stuff you usually make. While you wait for the water, start your sauce.",
          "Open a 28-oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes and drain contents in a colander set over medium bowl. (Whole peeled tomatoes are the only canned tomatoes worth buying, TBH. The diced ones sometimes have weird chemicals added to them to keep the chunks from breaking down. Gross.) Using clean fingers, poke a hole in the tomatoes and shake to drain liquid and seeds from the insides of each tomato, reserving liquid. Shake colander over bowl to separate the solids from all the juices and encourage liquid to drain; set aside.",
          "Smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef’s knife forcefully, so garlic breaks up into smaller bits; remove skins. If the cloves are really big, you might need to give them an extra smack to make sure they're broken up, but don't bother chopping—the garlic will infuse into the oil you sizzle it in and break down as the sauce simmers.",
          "Working next to your pasta pot, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. (We like using a Dutch oven or a large, high-sided skillet for cooking sauce and finishing pasta; it's kind of the only thing big enough to toss a whole pound of pasta in without noodles flying everywhere.) Add garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all over, about 3 minutes.",
          "Stir in a pinch of red pepper flakes, then add drained tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. The idea here is to concentrate the flavor of those tomato solids before adding the liquid they came in, which will give your sauce a more complex, rounded flavor. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are darkened in color, browned and caramelized in spots, and starting to break down, 6–8 minutes. Don't rush this part! If you aren't getting color, let it go for another few minutes. Mash with the back of the wooden spoon to form a coarse paste.",
          "Add reserved tomato liquid to pot and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of salt, throw in 3 basil sprigs, and reduce heat so sauce is bubbling at a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, 8–10 minutes. If your water isn’t boiling yet, turn off heat under sauce while you wait. If it is, reduce heat to lowest setting and move on.",
          "Add 1 lb. pasta to pot of water and agitate with tongs to prevent sticking. Cook pasta, tossing occasionally, just until lower end of time range given on the package for al dente. If you're not sure if it'sdone, fish out a piece and take a nibble—it should still be slightly too crunchy to want to eat because it's going to continue cooking in the tomato sauce. Just before pasta is done, use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop out about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.",
          "Using tongs, transfer pasta from stock pot into Dutch oven with sauce, allowing water to piggyback on pasta into sauce. (That's right, no draining!) Crank heat under sauce up to medium-high and pour in ½ cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. If you'e never finished cooking pasta in a pan full of sauce, your life is about to be changed—this process is what ensures that every single noodle is completely coated and infused with saucy goodness, and is pretty much the main difference between a dish of \"meh\" pasta and one that blows your mind.",
          "Cook pasta, tossing constantly, until sauce is clinging to eah noodle and any standing liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 minute. You still want a saucy consistency, but not watery. If things ever start to look a little dry, just add another splash of that pasta cooking water; if they look too wet, just wait a bit for some more liquid to evaporate.",
          "Slowly sprinkle in half of the Parmesan cheese (you want the grainy stuff with the texture of shaky cheese, not Micropaned), tossing constantly, until it has melted into the sauce. Add more pasta water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, to loosen sauce if necessary—it should be plenty saucy while you're incorporating the cheese so it emulsifies into the sauce properly. You want the sauce to ooze but still be thick enough to coat the pasta.",
          "Remove pot from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. butter until melted. Finishing with a bit of butter is almost always a good idea—it makes the finished dish extra glossy and delicious. (Don't look at us like that—if youthink pasta is diet food, you're kidding yourself.)",
          "Using tongs, divide pasta among bowls, then top with remaining cheese and basil leaves. Top with red pepper flakes and an extra drizzle of oil, if you feel. And there you have it: saucy, glossy Basically Spaghetti Pomodoro. Give yourself a pat on the back, and kiss the jarred stuff goodbye."

Dark brown sugar is key (keeping the bread ultra tender and moist), and a dollop of mascarpone (which you can sub with sour cream or yogurt if desired) makes for superior tenderness in the crumb. Chocolate and walnuts are optional but encouraged, and if you like an extra crunch, follow former BA test kitchen director and cookbook author Carla Lalli Music’s recommendation and sprinkle the top with raw sugar just before you put the pan in the oven. Serve slices plain or slathered with cream cheese or butter.",

        "description": "This dessert could grace a pastry shop window, but its elegance masks its ease (just as the shiny chocolate glaze covers up the bouncy-cushiony-chewy middle). The mochiko, or sweet rice flour, is what gives the cake its unique texture, and the earthy matcha and bittersweet chocolate make it not too sweet. In the spirit of the Hawaiian butter mochi that inspired the recipe, it requires minimal equipment and comes together in the time it takes the oven to heat up. Do take the time to sift the matcha, however—it ensures that there aren’t any dry bits in the final cake—and splurge for ceremonial-grade matcha if you want the most vibrant color possible.",
