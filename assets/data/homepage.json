        "description": "Our better-than-ever broccoli cheddar soup recipe is lighter and brighter than some you may have had in the past. It boasts a creaminess that comes from blended potatoes and broccoli stalks rather than heavy cream or the roux that many recipes call for—which means that, minus the optional garnish, this creamy soup is also gluten-free. Grating a block of sharp cheddar is crucial for this comfort food classic as the preshredded stuff is often mixed with an anti-caking agent that can wreak havoc with the silky texture of this delicious soup.\r\nThe other main player in broccoli cheese soup is, of course, the green stuff. The broccoli florets play two roles in this recipe: Half are added to the puréed base lending it a verdant hue, while the rest are mixed in toward the end, offering a nice crunch to break up the richness. Finally, in a nod to crusty bread bowls, we’ve added cheddar-topped croutons to every serving.\r\nFor a dairy-free broccoli soup, check out Andy Baraghani’s recipe with turmeric, peanuts, and crispy shallots or Hetty McKinnon’s broccoli and cashew number for a cream of broccoli soup experience that is completely vegan.",

An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of powerful flavor. In this herbaceous version, Hall doubles down on the fennel’s licorice notes by adding a glug of Pernod, an anise-based liqueur that’s a natural pairing with seafood and vegetables.\r\nUse this potlikker as a base for Hall’s Shrimp and Grits With Fennel Potlikker, her Lemony Spring Vegetable and Barley Bowl, or any dish that would benefit from an intensely aromatic broth.",

Half-and-half adds just the right amount of rich dairy flavor to help the cauliflower taste its best, but you could also use milk, heavy cream (or mix equal parts of both for DIY half-and-half), or plant-based milk. Don’t skip the white pepper or the fresh lemon juice—they’re the secret ingredients that’ll have you craving spoonful after spoonful.

        "description": "Pho was the dish my family gathered around every Sunday, whether we were at home or at our favorite spot in Los Angeles’s Chinatown. Even as I started to cook more vegetarian food as an adult, my craving for a filling, soul-edifying pho remained, and I spent years chasing down the right combination of ingredients that would produce a vegan pho broth just as umami-packed as one with beef bones. Here I landed on a mix of dried shiitake mushrooms, kombu (dried kelp), and miso to bring a nuanced complexity to the broth. (Read more about how I developed the recipe here.)",

        "description": "Beef and daikon are a classic pairing in Asian soups. Daikon brings a pleasant sweetness to the broth—it’s so juicy and soft when done right—while beef contributes richness and depth. To make this soup, you’ll start with bone-in short ribs, separating the meat from the bones and browning both with aromatics to build deep caramelized flavor. Then you’ll deglaze the pot with rice wine and cook everything down with added spices. The end result is a comforting soup brimming with cubes of fall-apart beef and super tender daikon that will get you through the last leg of winter.",

If you want to spice up this broth, however, you can add 4 Tbsp. Pixian chili bean paste and 15 dried chao tian jiao (or dried chiles de árbol) and cook for 2 minutes before adding the onions. Even if you aren’t making hot pot, you can use this broth as a flavorful (and vegan!) base for stews, soups, braises—or just something comforting to sip on.",

Preserved lemon, a pantry superstar if there ever was one, adds a brightness that cuts through the rich, stewy lentils. Because preserved lemons can vary in salt and acidity depending on the brand, you’ll want to adjust the amount of salt and lemon accordingly. As for the herbs, dill and basil work especially well in this soup, but you can use any tender herbs you have on hand. And if the toppers feel too involved for a Wednesday night (I get it!), feel free to spoon over a bit of your favorite store-bought chili crisp instead. ",

Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of meaty flavor. Here she makes potlikker with dry-cured country ham. If you can’t find country ham, smoked ham hocks will bring similar intensity.",

Olive oil reinforces the fruity savoriness and works with the sour cream to keep this loaf plush and moist for days.

Gluten-free and packed with protein, chickpea flour pancakes come in many variations across the world, from Indian besan chilla to French socca to Italian farinata. If you don’t feel like or have time to make pancake batter during your lunch break (though we highly recommend it!) large flour or alt-flour tortillas work wonderfully as a substitute; just fold the cooked greens and cheese inside the tortillas and heat directly in the skillet to melt the cheese.",

Here, quick-cooking fillets of fish are slathered in a deeply flavorful combination of miso, butter, and panko, then broiled until the breadcrumbs form a toasty, golden crust. My days as a line cook at Perry St restaurant in New York inspired the technique behind this dish. It was my first job out of culinary school, and in the winter we’d make a similar dish using roast cod topped with a thin sheet of truffle butter reinforced with panko. This is an easier, far more accessible version that’s just as tasty. I use my preferred technique of cooking fish with the skin on (it holds the flesh together as it cooks) yet with no intention of getting it crispy—I just lift the fish away from the skin when it’s time to serve. I find that chasing crispy fish skin is a heartbreaking pursuit, so I don’t even bother. Besides, you won’t miss it with all the texture from the buttery panko business on top. ",

If you don't have any lemon on hand, you can swap it out for lime (or a mixture of the two). Serve on the rocks with an orange wheel and a Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear (optional but recommended!), and enjoy. Cheers!",

Chocolate and walnuts are optional but encouraged, and if you like an extra crunch, follow former BA test kitchen director and cookbook author Carla Lalli Music’s recommendation and sprinkle the top with raw sugar just before you put the pan in the oven. Serve slices plain or slathered with cream cheese or butter.",
