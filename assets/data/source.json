      "content": "I didn’t always hate ketchup. As a kid I squirted it with abandon, drowning my french fries and hot dogs in red puddles. The slimy condiment was fun to eat and I didn’t care that it masked the flavor of everything it touched. In a way that was the point. But there’s a dramatic divide in my life when it comes to ketchup: Before, when its grossness was kind of fun, and After, when all I could think of when I looked at it, or smelled it, or even imagined it, was blood. Menstrual blood, to be exact.\r\nThe year was 1990. I was 13 and spending eight weeks at Camp Ramah in Ontario, Canada. Along with the 11 girls in my cabin, I decided to go bunk-hopping late at night—through the wooded ravine behind our hill to the boys’ camp. Our motive was simple: vengeance. Our mechanism: mess. And our medium: ketchup, something all summer camps have in abundance.\r\nThe week before, while we were away on an overnight camping trip, the boys had gone on an infamous panty raid, stealing our underwear and stringing it up on their outdoor laundry line for everyone to see. Now they were away on their camping trip. We had to retaliate and we wanted to show them, in as direct a way as possible, exactly why 13-year-old girls need their underwear.\r\nGiven that our nervous mothers had sent us with enough extra tampons and menstrual pads to supply an entire Lilith Fair, we had plenty to work with. Armed with our supplies, we donned our stealth black sweatpants, crawled across the field, and snuck into the boys’ cabins—where we proceeded to go to town. Not only did we soak the tampons and pads in ketchup, we squirted it. We slathered it. We sprayed it until each bunk looked like its own crime scene. It was vile, disgusting, and absolutely adolescent. And I could never look at ketchup the same way again. What was once a sauce had become a secretion.\r\nMy ketchup-free life didn’t feel like any kind of sacrifice. I became a vegetarian at 13 (that same summer, incidentally), and so my only grilling options were precooked tofu dogs or hard, flat, greige-colored rounds masqueraded as “veggie burgers.” Not even ketchup was going to bring them back from bland oblivion. And the rest of my veg-heavy meals rarely needed the condiment. I dipped my fries in mayonnaise. I enjoyed tomato sauce (only guilty by association) atop spaghetti. Mustard was my grilled cheeses’ BFF.\r\nThen, 30 years later, the Impossible (burger) happened. By 2018 the vegetarian alternatives I fed my own family had come a long way—they were no longer sad substitutions but truly delicious options that even meat lovers were buying into. I began to crave the actual taste of veggie burgers and dogs as much as the nostalgic ritual. I wasn’t just slapping a misc. disk between the much more appealing bun anymore but savoring the flavors.\r\nAs I watched my kids eagerly load their burgers—with cheese, and lettuce, and maybe avocado, and definitely ketchup—I got a little…regretful? A little wistful. Maybe I was jealous. Even though the viscosity still struck a visceral chord, and even though the condiment was no less redolent of a particular secretion, I wanted to try again.\r\nSo one day I gave a tentative squeeze. I spread, sparingly but substantially. And then I tasted. It was a revelation. That first bite of burger was almost crunchy, with a seared exterior that soon melted into a juicy, tangy, and shockingly meaty inside. Each chomp delivered with it a hit of ketchup. My mouth watered. Then my eyes watered. Probably my kids were wondering if Imma was finally losing it. In a way I was. As the sweet umami-packed tang took over my senses, I spiraled back decades—past a montage of ketchup-devoid scenes—to the Before times. It was exactly as I remembered: kinda gross, kinda amazing, and virtually impossible to stop eating.\r\nAs it turns out, unlike teenage retaliation, the marriage of ketchup and burger is a wise and wonderful choice. While the burger was my gateway, adult me learned that the salty-sweet substance is the perfect complement to piping hot french fries, crispy onion rings, and oven-baked vegan nuggets. Look, I’m not about to slather ketchup on my pasta (blasphemy!) or put it on my latkes or eggs. That red bottle still has no place at my breakfast table. And I firmly believe its application should enhance rather than cancel the neighboring flavors.\r\nBut now that burgers are a part of my menu, ketchup is a part of my burgers. And while those patties have been bloodless since I was 13, these days I’m very happy to add a bit of sticky red sauce."

      "content": "In Hervé Le Tellier’s Goncourt Prize-winning novel, The Anomaly (spoilers straight ahead), an airplane traveling from Paris to New York emerges from a storm and lands safely at JFK—and then, three months later, the same plane reappears in the sky. Like, the exact same plane. Same flight crew, same passengers, all duplicates of people who have been living on Earth for the past three months. The doppelgangers must learn to inhabit the same world despite branching lives—one woman is two months pregnant; her double is not. The plane’s captain is days away from death, riddled with cancer; his double has three more months to live. Is this all proof that “reality” as we know it is a simulation? That there’s a great photocopier in the sky?\r\nThese questions and more—so many more—flitted through my head as I examined this Amazon listing for the half-gallon, BPA-free, leakproof Pankio sports water bottle, which my colleague Tiffany Hopkins recently wrote about. Its product images show hale, sporty individuals in scenes of exercise and leisure. In one, a blonde woman on a yoga mat engages her left glute while holding tabletop position. In another, a man wearing suede ankle boots sits casually on a flight of steps. Beside both of them: a Pankio sports water bottle with anti-slip handle and flip-top lid.\r\nIn each image, the size of the bottle in relation to its human companion differs wildly. For Yoga Woman, the Pankio water bottle looks longer than her forearm. But Suede Boot Man easily palms the top of his Pankio, which extends not halfway up his shin. We are left with two conclusions—one, that the Pankio water bottle retains its physical integrity in all scenarios, and the size of humans varies beyond our current perception. The other, that the size of humans is fixed, within a certain spectrum, and the Pankio water bottle can and does exist in myriad corporeal forms simultaneously.\r\nIs the Pankio water bottle bigger than a tennis racket? Smaller than a golden retriever’s head? Should I carry my dog in a backpack? The answer to all these questions is yes. The cat in the box is both alive and dead. The Pankio water bottle contains exactly one half gallon of water and also the multitudes of the ocean. The deeper I delved into the cosmology of Amazon, the more evidence I found that the physical world is capricious. These TeamFar sheet pans, for instance, hold asparagus larger than a meat cleaver but can also fit easily into a toaster oven. In quantum mechanics, particles retain a fixed state—heads or tails, if you will—when observed, but these same particles exist in multiple states at the same time when not observed. When I’m not shopping for water bottles and sheet pans, do they exist in infinite sizes, shapes, and colors at once?\r\nIn his seminal work The World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer writes, “Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung,” which roughly translates to “The Pankio water bottle is but my representation.” Is it possible to have objective knowledge of the world? Although I have watched a Pankio video review by Amazon user EsteeDarla, I have not held the Pankio water bottle. I have not sipped from its phthalate-free food grade plastic lid. But within this vast multiverse, among the infinite Pankios scattered through the beyond, somewhere a MacKenzie Chung Fegan is playing tennis, her Pankio water bottle stood in the middle of the court beside her."

      "content": "Dinner parties were never dull in Downton Abbey, Julian Fellowes’s breakout upstairs-downstairs drama. And they surely are not in his latest show, The Gilded Age, or his new film, Downton Abbey: A New Era either. Here the author, screenwriter, director, baron, and member of the UK’s House of Lords reveals who he’d have at his own fantasy fete.\r\n<b>You have two period pieces out now which focus on English and New York society, respectively. Which group of characters would you prefer to party with?</b>New York would have been more fun. At the time the ways of the English were all quite settled and seemingly low-energy. But in New York, Mrs. Astor had forged this new society, mixing the old families and the old money with the new arrivals who came with great fortunes and built their palaces up and down Fifth Avenue. Their parties, with people like Alva Vanderbilt and Jay Gould, would have been pretty good fun.\r\n<b>If you could invite any three people—dead or alive—who would they be and why?</b>Apart from my wife, of course, I’d have to invite Marilyn Monroe. The thing about movie stars is in order to be emotionally moving, they must convey a sense of needing the viewer’s help. Marilyn had that more than anyone. You wanted to get her safely through the story. I’d also invite Ella Fitzgerald, my all-time favorite singer. There was mastery in the way she took possession of a song. I’d also like to learn what it was like to be a Black woman who was a huge star at a time of ubiquitous racist persecution. Like the time she was traveling to Australia for one of her greatest tours, and she and her companions were thrown off the plane. The third guest would be novelist Anthony Trollope. I’m president of the Trollope Society, and while many look down on him, as if he were writing soap operas instead of proper dramas, I believe he had a much more modern take on people. His heroines were never all good—they’re not Dickens’s sainted angels wearing white—and his villains were never all bad.\r\n<b>Like Thomas Barrow from Downton Abbey, a perfect villain. Where do you host?</b>In my dining room in Dorset, with its long table and Gothic chairs. We’d use the china with the family crest and turquoise trim, and the room would be lit with silver candlesticks.\r\n<b>What do you serve?</b>We’d start with ice-chilled vichyssoise, followed by coronation chicken, a cold dish with a sauce made out of cream, mayonnaise, apricot jam, onions, and curry. It was invented for the present queen’s coronation and is absolutely delicious. For pudding, crepes Suzette with Cointreau in it, served with a glass of Beaumes-de-Venise.\r\n<b>What’s the opening conversation starter?</b>These guests and I have been up against people who didn’t believe in us. Producer Darryl Zanuck and others didn’t think Monroe was really an actress. Ella Fitzgerald was rejected by the establishment. I’ve had my material dismissed by many. You have to find your own faith in yourself. When I meet young people who are in a similar situation, I say to them, “Stay away from those who don’t believe in you. Later on, when your career has fallen into place, you can pick them up again. But in the beginning, there is a limit to how much negativity you can withstand.”"

      "content": "We were going to miss our flight out of Venice. My husband, Guillaume, and I were on the last leg of our honeymoon trip from Catalonia to Italy, and we’d already left the honeymoon phase. The night before, at an outdoor terrace in Venice with swingy jazz in the air and expertly stirred negronis in our hands, we had been arguing. (Our subject was an Instagram post; trivial now, but very consequential in the moment.) The sky turned inky, a third round of negronis dried up, and we ended up at a tourist trap near the canal, twirling forks of spaghetti carbonara while the tension hung thicker than gelato. The next morning we snoozed through our 6 a.m. wakeup call—and after navigating a maze of narrow streets and one requisite journey by boat-taxi, heads throbbing from the previous night’s cocktails, arrived late to the airport check-in counter. That was when the ticketing agent informed us that the name on my reservation did not match the name on my passport.\r\nIn an instant our conflict slipped away as a larger, more pressing issue materialized before us. Wordlessly, as if following some invisible choreography, Guillaume and I snapped into a single synchronized unit. I forgot my head’s dull ache and began rattling off reasons for the discrepancy. “We just got married,” I said, praying our Italian gatekeeper would take pity on honeymooners, “and I changed my legal name but the reservation shows my birth name.” In his decent Italian, Guillaume peppered in words that I didn't understand but sounded very charming. The agent’s mouth curved into a tentative smile. I exhaled.\r\nSomehow we advanced to the other side of security. Victorious and thirsty, we perched at the bar of a concourse pizza restaurant and ordered two glasses of prosecco. People hurried past hauling their roll-y suitcases. A solo traveler idled by the illuminated grab-and-go food counter near us. Amid it all we clinked our flutes and took a celebratory sip. The wine was too sweet and the bubbles almost nonexistent, and yet I felt effervescent, buoyed by our successful tag team. I let my eyes trace the profile of my husband’s tanned face as he sipped the barely fizzy drink. At perhaps the most unromantic bar in Venice, I was filled with love and gratitude—for the man who was legally bound to be my lifelong travel partner, and for our continued journey together.\r\nMy husband and I might throw down at a quaint restaurant as a gondolier paddles past in his striped shirt and straw hat. We might sit in silence, post-argument, over sumptuous plates of pasta. But for us, the airport, stripped of any ambience, tends to be a happy place. It’s where we let the everyday worries slip away to focus on our greater mission: making it through security with our personal effects intact and arriving at our gate with some minutes to spare. And when we can spend those minutes sharing a quick drink before takeoff, we relish the imminent sense of adventure, of leaving the familiar behind in pursuit of the new. It’s the feeling of being fully present for each other for a brief window of time, until an overhead announcement summons us to begin boarding.\r\nIn the nearly five years since that quixotic honeymoon, we’ve moved to Paris and had a baby. With the pandemic, we fly less frequently, and when we do, between the N95 masks and the milk bottles and the tote bags stuffed with toddler paraphernalia, we don’t travel as light. But a pit stop at an airport watering hole remains our sacred ritual—the drinks might not be top shelf, but it’s a place where my husband and I pause for a moment and reconnect.\r\nRecently, we spent time in New York to visit my family. When we arrived at JFK for our return flight to Paris, I felt a certain heaviness as I reckoned with the uncertainty of when we’d return and what the world would look like then. Not to mention, Mimi, now a fiery two-year-old, had been battling a cold and her parents (us) were ragged from lack of sleep. But as we neared the security line, I watched my husband deftly break down the stroller. My heart swelled. I removed my shoes and coaxed our precious cargo, Mimi, through the metal detector. As I waited for Guillaume on the other side, I thought, We really do make a good team.\r\nIn the concourse, we parked ourselves at a row of seats and under the bright airport lights ordered drinks from an iPad. Mimi plunged french fries into a pool of ketchup. I sipped an oaky Chard poured from a mini bottle. Guillaume took a swig from a draft beer. Nearby a line grew outside of the women’s bathroom. The noise around us dissolved into a steady hum: luggage gliding, heels clicking, the occasional whir of a distant airplane.\r\nI looked at my husband and saw a reflection of myself—older and paler than journeys past, but carrying so much more love with us. We finished our drinks and headed toward the gate, ready to get in line for another flight together."

      "content": "I’ve historically been a gear gal, nerding out over the best espresso machines and high-tech rice cookers and sous vide machines. But four months into culinary school, I’ve found my tastes have taken a more austere turn, and I've been completely won over by the no-frills equipment of a teaching kitchen. The single exception to this: that espresso machine. It’s possible to make a good—great!—cup of coffee with plenty of humble at-home brewing processes. But for espresso drinkers like me, the Breville Bambino Plus Espresso Maker is worth the cost and the extra time each morning, and it’s my pick for the best espresso machine on the market.\r\nI love all the shiny clunkiness of my beloved Breville espresso machine. The satisfying click of the portafilter, the roar of the steam wand. I love the piping hot double shot of espresso each morning, complete with a foamy, golden crema—and most of all, the weekend cappuccino, topped with a little cloud of frothed oat milk. That fantastically delicious morning coffee is all possible because the Bambino is small enough to slip between the sink and the stove in even the teeniest apartment kitchens, like mine.\r\nYes, there’s plenty of easier ways to brew coffee at home, and making great espresso is an expensive, time-consuming process with a learning curve. But if you’re regularly ducking out for americanos or macchiatos and your gear-loving self is itching to commit to a home espresso machine, join me in adoring the Breville Bambino Plus—the best espresso machine at its price point in my book. Or check out the other espresso machine recommendations below that cover a variety of price points and levels of ease.\r\n<header>What’s so great about the Breville Bambino Plus?</header>This is a goldilocks machine. The Breville Bambino Plus is semi-automatic, which means it’s not fully manual or fully automatic—it’s just right. The machine uses a pump to get the pressure right in your shot, making it easy enough for beginners. About half an hour of manual-reading (or video-watching, for my fellow manual-averse people) and a few practice shots will have you on your way to coffee shop-quality espresso. After playing around to figure out the right grind size, each shot I pulled was rich and flavorful, and I found that the machine had very few quirks.\r\nIt’s also speedy. One of the biggest reasons an espresso machine takes dedication each morning is the timing of all the little steps. Some machines need to be constantly refilled—luckily, this one has a roomy water reservoir. Others take ages for the heating mechanism to switch from espresso making to steaming milk—not the Bambino Plus, with its ThermoJet heater. Even though it has a cost-and-space saving single boiler, it’s ready to pull a shot about three seconds after you turn it on, and it starts steaming milk in the same amount of time. If you prefer milky espresso drinks like lattes, you can even set the steam wand to an automatic setting and skip that extra minute of foamy fiddling.\r\nWith the Bambino Plus, brewing espresso is hard to mess up, so it’s safe for houseguests and roommates. The steam wand auto purges the last drops of milk lest someone in your household “forget” to clean it. The drip tray even has a handy light up feature, reminding you when it’s time to empty it. And like the other Breville tools we love, it’s sturdily made. (Plus, it has a 2-year warranty.)\r\nOne note—this one doesn’t come with a built-in grinder, which is a plus for those with limited counter space. (Expect to make way for something slightly smaller than a stand mixer.) Which means you probably want to invest in a conical burr grinder to go with it since freshly ground coffee beats pre-ground any day of the week—but you already knew that.\r\n<header>My countertop is enormous. Gimme the option that comes with the grinder.</header>The Breville Barista Touch is the semi-automatic pick for spacious suburban kitchens. It’s five inches wider and three inches longer than the Bambino and includes a conical burr grinder, along with a hot water wand. At first glance, you might think that touch screens are a bit like...cheating? But unlike similarly sized Breville models, the Barista Touch really does boast all the ease of the Bambino, with the same foolproof milk frother and quick heating transition from espresso to steam wand.\r\n<header>What about the best old school espresso machines?</header>If you're in the market for a classic commercial machine at a home-cook price point, go for an Italian machine like the Rancilio Silvia. (For a competitor option, check out BA's review of the Gaggia Classic Pro.) “Rancilio specialized in commercial machines, and this type of machine was made as a sample to send as a gift to their distributors,” explains Suyog Mody, co-founder of Boston-based coffee subscription company Driftaway. “It ended up becoming so popular that they decided to release it on the consumer market.” The Silvia still boasts commercial construction, so expect it to last and last. Mody loves that it’s low-profile and quieter than most home machines—and that the customer support is helpful as you begin to tinker with the parts and upgrade or replace them over time. (Great espresso machines are like classic cars; you can customize and update certain parts instead of getting a whole new one.)\r\nLike the Bambino, investing in a good conical burr grinder to go alongside the Rancilio Silvia is key. Also like the Bambino, there are two filter baskets included, one for single shots and one for double. The price difference here really comes down to longevity—this is a commercial-grade machine with stainless steel, brass, and copper parts that are all easily replaceable or upgradable. It’s a bit more finicky than the Breville (some people find the lack of a PID system, which regulates pressure and temperature, annoying) but, this could easily be a ten or fifteen year machine with a little care.\r\n<header>What if I’m a pro looking for La Marzocco quality at home?</header>Laura Perry, co-founder of Luna Coffee (another one of my favorite coffee subscription picks) recommends the Decent DE1. “It’s not cheap, but the Decent DE1 is awesome for a few reasons,” she says. “It’s got incredible temperature control at the grouphead (a rarity for home machines), and there’s a tablet to graph and deploy shot profiles.” Take all the information that built-in coffee iPad gives you and go check out the Decent Espresso chat room, “which [provides] lots of support as you embark on your espresso nerd quest,” says Perry. This is a pro pick with a pro price: the Decent DE1 Pro, the latest model of the machine that Perry loves (and employs at Luna Coffee HQ), is $3,399.\r\n<header>What if I’m looking for something to do most of the heavy lifting itself?</header>My first espresso maker was a super-automatic Jura—and to be honest, it made such consistently good espresso that it outperformed the Bambino for the first few weeks, while I was still learning the ropes. A fully automatic coffee machine measures and grinds the beans and pulls the shot. Some machines also froth milk. All you need to do is fill the water tank and replenish the coffee beans and the Jura will make you the coffee drink of your choice at the push of a button. It's about as involved as popping in a Nespresso pod—there is no grinding beans or tamping down a portafilter involved. There's nothing wrong with that, and if you prefer the ease of an automatic espresso machine and can stand the price, I do recommend the Jura. But it is less FUN."

      "content": "I grew up in a large, loud, close family. Doors were always open, conversations were shouted between rooms, personal space nonexistent. When I moved out—first to a dorm, followed by an apartment near campus with my best friend, and then to an attic in a house downtown occupied by Craigslist strangers—I cherished the independence that I was never afforded growing up. But it came at the cost of instability and more than occasional bouts of loneliness. My kitchen appliances were mostly sourced from Ikea, cheap and functional enough to make the three vegan recipes I knew.\r\nWhen I was 24, one morning I was in a shop that specializes in whimsically curated cookbooks and cookware, looking at a Le Creuset baking dish that cost half my rent and imagining the ways in which a person must have their life pulled together to own such a thing. A friend of mine was working in the store and she asked me how I was doing. I shared with her my current landlord woes. I would have to leave my attic apartment the following month and I had no idea where I would live next. “You should talk to Lara,” she said, motioning to her curly-haired coworker behind the cash register. “She needs a roommate.”\r\nI moved into Lara’s apartment that May. The kitchen was the main feature of the place, spacious and filled with natural light, shelves lined with cookbooks. She had an eye for mid-century cookware, and her collection of vintage pieces was supplemented with recent acquisitions purchased with her employee discount. She treated cooking as a pleasurable act, one in which she invested great care. I put my Ikea pots and pans in the storage closet.\r\nShe came home from work one day with a Le Creuset French press in its since-discontinued bright green Palm shade. My old drip coffee maker was acting up, so I asked her if I could use it. “Help yourself,” she said. Lara was always generous with sharing her stuff, and besides, she explained, she preferred her pour-over coffee anyway. From that morning, I quietly adopted the French press as my own, and she quietly let me.\r\nRoommates are often treated as a stopgap measure, a living arrangement to be endured in your 20s before moving in with a partner or living alone. In my noisy childhood home, my bedroom was a private sanctuary. I knew I never wanted to share a room with somebody, but I valued knowing there was always someone next door to keep me company. Each morning when I use the French press, I am reminded that it was brought into my life by a person who represents the comforts of home—who isn’t family but feels like she is.\r\nI am 31 years old now, and Lara and I have lived together for nearly seven years. My morning routine has remained fairly consistent. I wake up, amble into the kitchen, turn on the kettle, and scoop several heaping tablespoons of coffee into the French press. I pour in a little hot water to give the grinds a chance to bloom (another trick my roommate taught me) before filling it up. Lara is usually nearby, prepping the travel mug she takes to work. We chat for a few minutes, fill up our mugs, and go our separate ways.",

      "content": "I came across the Gaggia Classic Pro espresso machine in the most dire of circumstances. It was my first day on the job here at BA, and my trusty drip coffeemaker simply stopped working just when I needed it most. I took it as a sign that it was, finally, time to seriously consider a home espresso machine.\r\nAs a former barista I drink espresso daily and know what I like. Most days it’s an Americano (a double shot of espresso topped with hot water and a generous splash of cream) made at home. Occasionally I’ll opt for a cappuccino—espresso with whole milk frothed to the approximate texture of the heady foam atop a great pour of Guinness draught. I know the telltale signs that beans have been over-extracted (bitter and burnt espresso) and I notice when a cappuccino has been frothed so aggressively that the milk has practically evaporated.\r\nAll this is to say that the semiautomatic Gaggia is a great espresso machine for someone like me who knows how they want their coffee to taste and isn’t afraid of a little espresso geekery. I appreciate the control I have over everything from the density and weight of the coffee grounds to the pressure used to froth milk. I didn’t want a machine with a touch screen or any “smart” features; I wanted to pull shots and steam milk by feel, learning the timing, texture, and temperature that was right for me. (Plus, in my experience with touch screen espresso machines in office kitchenettes and cafeterias, software or firmware issues can prevent you from actually using the machine, even if there’s nothing wrong with its mechanics. It’s frustrating enough to have to troubleshoot my laptop and its applications to do my job; I have no interest in having to contact IT about my morning coffee.)\r\nMachines intended for the home coffee enthusiast can cost as much as $10K (and by all means, if you can afford a La Marzocco, get a La Marzocco), but the Gaggia Classic Pro had the mix of specs and features I wanted for a price that was comparatively more reasonable. At $449, it’s still pricey, but after over a year of continuous use, it has proven to be reliable for morning Americanos, after-dinner affogato, and, with a little practice, a deliciously sippable espresso shot with picture-perfect crema.",

      "content": "The happiest moment of my day is at 7 a.m. when I wake up, stumble into the kitchen, listen to the buzz of my Breville Barista Express as it powers on, and brew a perfect cup of coffee. It’s the way I love to start my day, a sacred morning ritual that is for me and only me. I had my coffee- making system down pat, but I'd often run into a very unfortunate issue—I'd go through all the preparations of making my morning coffee only to realize I was out of beans. Big groan. Would I have to drag myself to a grocery store for a mediocre bag of coffee beans? Would I default to buying cold brew from my local coffee shop for the third day in a row? My routine was dialed in, but running out of coffee beans became the one recurring hiccup to my near-perfect morning.\r\nThis cycle of torture finally ended a few years ago, when my husband casually mentioned that he had signed us up for a coffee subscription called Trade Coffee, a service that would deliver freshly roasted, ethically sourced bags of coffee every few weeks right to our doorstep. (It also happens to be one of BA’s favorite coffee subscription services.) We took a curated quiz online to share how we make our coffee, the type of roast we typically prefer, our experience with making coffee, and our taste preferences. A few days later, the first shipment arrived—a brightly colored bag from Red Rooster Coffee in Floyd, Virginia. It was a medium roast blend with sweet notes of berry and undertones of chocolate, and it was delicious. I also learned that Trade Coffee is dedicated to sustainability—their coffee bags are biodegradable and some of their partner roasters compost their coffee bean chaff with local farms—and passionate about community. The company pays careful attention to sourcing and ethical prices directly to farmers and roasters. I was completely sold—high-quality coffee I can feel good about!",

      "content": "I am happily addicted to caffeine. Most mornings I’ll brew a pot at home with beans, usually medium roasts with notes of chocolate or caramel, sourced from whatever coffee shop I was at when I was due for a refill. But when I’m on deadline or wake up groggy from a late night out, grinding beans and making fresh coffee feels like an insurmountable task. Instant coffee isn’t an option for me—I guess you could call me a coffee snob—so when a friend told me about Cometeer, I was immediately curious.\r\nThe Massachusetts-based company makes frozen coffee capsules by grinding beans at peak freshness, brewing them at 10 times the strength of normal coffee, then flash-freezing the results into concentrated pods for easy home melting. Developed by a team of MIT chemists and engineers, Cometeer’s proprietary extraction technology considers factors such as oxidation, grind size, and roast level to achieve the best-tasting coffee, which is then plunged in a liquid nitrogen bath to lock in the flavor. And they work with some of the country’s top roasters like Counter Culture out of Durham, Equator from San Francisco, and New York’s Joe Coffee.\r\nI ordered a mixed box of 32 Cometeer coffee capsules. When they came in the mail a few days later, I boiled a pot of water, popped an icy brown puck into a mug, and poured the hot water over the frozen concentrate. Not only was the cup of coffee delicious, but as I made my way through the various roasts in my box, I was able to notice the nuances of body and flavor in each variety.\r\n“I’ve been in this business for 20 years, and we love to wax about how coffee should be appreciated like wine, but there’s always been this inescapable elephant in the room, which is that you do not need to brew your own wine,” says Kyle Glanville, founder of Go Get Em Tiger in Los Angeles, one of Cometeer’s roasting partners. For Glanville, Cometeer eliminates the barrier for people to enjoy high-quality coffee at home. Since melting a capsule with hot water doesn’t require any equipment or skill, he says Cometeer’s process is a “profound step forward” for brewing specialty coffee in their own homes.\r\nCometeer coffee pods can also be utilized in a number of other ways. Once you run a sealed capsule under warm water, you can use it in any K-cup compatible machine (like a Keurig), combine it with cold water or milk for iced coffee or a latte, pour it over ice cream to make an affogato, or shake it with vodka, simple syrup, and ice for an espresso martini. Better yet, Cometeer is a more sustainable option than typical coffee pods: the aluminum packaging is recyclable and the company composts all of their used grounds.\r\nKeeping Cometeer in my freezer hasn’t changed my entire attitude towards coffee. I still hit my neighborhood coffee shops a few times a week, buy beans, and brew coffee fresh. But it has made it easier than ever to enjoy a great cup of coffee. That’s true when traveling too. Although I’ve yet to take Cometeer on the road, the company promises that the pods taste great for up to 24 hours after they’ve been thawed. And at under one fluid ounce per pod, they’re TSA-approved, so you can take them on the plane. Next time I’m headed somewhere where the coffee situation is unpredictable, Cometeer is coming with.",

      "content": "When it comes to the best ways to make coffee, plenty of people have Strong Opinions on how it should be done, what gadgets are necessary or not, and what exactly constitutes a good cup. We’re here to say—let’s all take a breath. “The perfect cup of coffee is the one you enjoy,” says Areli Barrera de Grodski, co-owner of Little Waves Coffee Roasters and Cocoa Cinnamon coffee shop in Durham, North Carolina. We could pit the French press against the pour-over and debate which method is better all day, but the truth is, most baristas agree that you can brew great coffee with any method and any tools you have on hand. Whether you love the ritual of making your cup manually or you adore your automatic coffee maker, there’s no wrong method—but each has its pluses and minuses. We spoke to Barrera de Grodski and other coffee experts about their favorite ways to make coffee at home and how to improve your morning cup of joe, regardless of how you like to brew it.\r\n<header>Drip Coffee Maker</header>If your household drinks a lot of coffee or you just want something that’s convenient and essentially foolproof, Barrera de Grodski believes that a solid batch brewer (a.k.a. drip machine) is the way to go. “I love the idea of pressing a button and making good coffee that’s well-balanced, slightly sweet, and so good that it doesn’t need milk or sugar,” she says. “I can easily achieve that with my batch coffee maker.” The flavor of your cup, she explains, will depend on the water you’re using, the ratio of grounds to water, and, of course, the type of coffee itself. For better coffee, start with freshly roasted beans and filtered water and use a scale to measure a coffee-to-water ratio of 1-to-16, or 16 grams of water for every gram of coffee. Note: This is a great starting ratio, but you can (and should!) adjust according to your preference.\r\nWhen it comes to making coffee at home, Sarah Elisabeth Huggins, co-owner of Daughter in Brooklyn, New York, is also on team automatic coffee machine: “I love my Moccamaster, and have no shame in filling it with Café Bustelo.” Baristas also recommend the Bonavita 8-cup Coffee Maker, which Barrera de Grodski likes specifically for its showerhead dripper, which evenly disperses the water onto a flat bed of coffee and allows for an even extraction.\r\n<header>The French Press</header>/r/nIf you’re into rich, full-bodied coffee, then the French press is for you. This method brews by soaking ground coffee directly in hot water—sans filter—rather than letting water pass through the grounds. Aki Yaguchi, head barista at Migrant Coffee in Melbourne, Australia, likes this method for its robust flavor: “Since the water sits in contact with the coffee for longer without a filter, the results are more well-rounded with bolder, richer flavor,” she says, “It’s creamier and less watery.”\r\nHere’s how it works: Pour the grounds into the carafe, fill it with hot water, and stir it to make sure all of the coffee is properly saturated. Wait four minutes, put the lid on, and slowly depress the plunger to isolate all of the grounds at the bottom of the carafe.\r\nFor the best results, use a coarser grind (Yaguchi loves her Porlex Mini Stainless-Steel Coffee Grinder) and make sure your water isn’t too hot. These factors play a big role in brewing coffee that isn’t under- or over-extracted. “I think there’s this misconception that coffee has to be at boiling point, but you want it to be at roughly 194°F to properly extract the flavors and not burn the coffee.” If you’ve heated your water to a boil, let it sit for a minute to cool down before brewing. And once the coffee has finished brewing, decant it into a mug as soon as possible instead of letting it sit in the French press so it doesn’t become over-extracted.\r\n<header>The Pour-Over</header>/r/nIf you want a delicate, lighter-bodied coffee that gives you (almost) complete control over the flavor of your cup, then you’ll appreciate a classic pour-over coffee. It’s made by placing a simple filter cone over a coffee cup or carafe, filling that filter with ground coffee, and then pouring hot water over it and letting it drip through. It’s a favorite among baristas, and it’s the method Huggins turns to when she wants to delicately extract all of the coffee’s tasting notes. “With a pour-over, you have the paper filter that removes some of the heavy oils. You have control over the speed of the pour and how many rounds of pouring there are,” says Huggins. “I like having that level of control.”\r\nWith pour-overs, it’s even more important to make sure you’ve got the right grind size, water temperature, and coffee-to-water ratio. Baristas recommend using a burr grinder (manual or electric) and a gooseneck kettle for better precision. “The grind size will determine the brew time,” says co-owner of Daughter Brian Stoothoff, “If the coffee is taking too long to come down, the grind is too fine—if the water is flowing too fast, it’s too coarse.” A brew time that’s too fast will lead to coffee that tastes salty and sour, while a longer brew time that’s too slow will lead to coffee that tastes bitter, ashy, and burnt. “You want to hit that sweet spot for balanced acidity, bitterness, and sweetness,” says Stoothoff. “Shoot for between two and a half and four minutes.” The method takes a little patience and practice, but once you’ve got it down it becomes a no-brainer.\r\n<header>The Aeropress</header>/r/nThe Aeropress is a favorite for coffee lovers on the go. This compact brewing device acts in the same way that a syringe does, with a plunger forcing hot water and grounds through a filter and straight into your cup. Coffee brewed in an Aeropress boasts a super-quick brew time and is generally smooth with low acidity. Some people claim that the Aeropress turns out single-serve coffee that’s as strong as espresso, since technically you’re brewing it under pressure, but actually that isn’t possible. No matter: It’s compact and lightweight enough to bring just about anywhere you go. “It’s a great device for beginner coffee makers who are brewing a single cup. It’s so simple to use and easy to clean,” says Huggins.\r\n<header>Espresso Machine</header>/r/nIf you like extremely strong coffee and espresso-based drinks (and have extra counter space and the money to spend)—then you may want to consider getting an espresso maker. In this brewing method, a small amount of hot water is forced under a large amount of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a super concentrated coffee. The high pressure also speeds up the extraction and brewing process to between 20 to 30 seconds, so you have a shorter period to hit that flavor extraction “sweet spot.” Of all the popular coffee brewing methods, espresso takes the crown for being the most finicky, so use a burr grinder and scale and familiarize yourself with your machine.\r\n“When making an espresso, your grinder is your biggest point of control,” says Huggins. “When making espresso at the shop, I’m constantly tweaking the grind dose and grind size.” If your espresso doesn’t taste good, those are the first two variables to play with.\r\n<header>The Moka pot</header>/r/nIf you want to make strong coffee but don’t feel inclined to purchase an espresso machine, the Moka pot (a.k.a. stovetop percolator) is for you. Like with espresso, boiling water—pressurized by steam—is passed through ground coffee, and the result is rich, flavorful, and highly concentrated. When Yaguchi isn’t using her French press, she’s reaching for her Moka pot: “It does take a little more attention and practice, but using a Moka pot is a fun, somewhat whimsical experience.”\r\n<header>Cold brew</header>/r/nPrefer your coffee over ice? Cold brew is made by soaking coffee grounds in cold or room temperature water for 16 to 24 hours. It’s a slow extraction method, and the result is a smooth, heavy-bodied coffee. You can use a large mason jar and a sieve, but Yaguchi loves the Toddy Cold Brew System, which creates a concentrate that’s less acidic. All you have to do is fill the Toddy with coffee and water, refrigerate it overnight, and extract the concentrate the next day. When you’re ready to drink, pour it over ice and dilute it with three parts water. “It makes a really delicious, strong cold brew,” Yaguchi adds.\r\nYou can also flash-brew iced coffee by making regular coffee or coffee concentrate, then pouring it over ice. Barrera de Grodski also recommends the Coldwave Beverage Chiller, which cools hot beverages to room temperature in minutes. “Essentially, you create a regular brew and instantly make it cold without diluting it—and you don’t have to make a concentrate,” she says."

At my family’s dacha on the outskirts of Moscow, much of our summer abundance from the garden is canned, pickled, frozen, or somehow preserved for the long winter ahead. But even in my current home in Queens, I have a whole section of the fridge dedicated to jars and containers where water, salt, and vinegar are working their magic on cabbage, green tomatoes, and even tofu. While tofu is not a traditional Russian ingredient, when it's brined it actually makes an excellent dairy-free stand-in for feta.\r\nAs I began reducing dairy and animal protein in my diet for multiple reasons, I had trouble finding a store-bought replacement for brined cheeses like feta. The manufactured options were just not cutting it texture- and taste-wise. “Why is it so sweet?” I often asked myself when going through different brands. That was before I realized I could get that crumbly, salty, tangy flavor by brining extra-firm tofu. Tofu acts like a sponge, and after it sops up a simple three-ingredient brine made from pantry staples, it delivers an almost identical flavor to traditional fetas.\r\n<header>Here’s how to make tofu feta:</header>Drain and press 1 block firm or extra-firm tofu to get rid of excess water. Get out a clean jar or container with a lid (I like using 16-oz. wide-mouth mason jars). Tear 1\"–2\" chunks of the tofu and nestle them into the jar. Dissolve 1 Tbsp. kosher salt by whisking it with ⅓ cup white vinegar and ½ cup hot water. Slowly pour it into the jar, then seal, date, and shake it. Once the jar cools off, send it into the fridge overnight.\r\nThe tofu feta will keep in the fridge for up to four weeks, if you don’t eat it all first. One of my favorite ways to serve it is to marinate the chunks with olive oil, lemon zest and juice, oregano, and thyme on the countertop for about 15 minutes. Adorn with Halkidiki and Castelvetrano olives and enjoy on its own or with some toasted pita—don’t forget to mop up the marinade at the bottom of the bowl! You can also crumble it into your salads and wraps or make it the main star of a plant-forward sandwich. Or blitz it in a high-speed blender with some of the brine, olive oil, and herbs to make a creamy dip or spread.\r\nA delight for vegans and a surprise for omnivores, tofu feta (or tofeta, as I call it) will be a welcome addition to your easy pickling projects. In the meantime I’ll be searching for my own jar among the crowded landscape of sauerkraut and pickled green tomatoes, then shamelessly eating it in the glow of the fridge."

      "content": "A great man once said, “We’re riding the bus to Flavortown!” Indeed, Guy Fieri, indeed. And with this mushroom stock, it’s an express bus. Mushroom stock comes together fast, with only a handful of ingredients—and there are so many ways you can use it. Unlike a stock based on animal protein like chicken or beef, mushroom stock can be enjoyed hot or cold, making it endlessly versatile\r\nI can channel a Laurel Canyon woman dressed in all white and just sip on the warm broth, feeling restored and hoping for peace for the world. But more often than not, on a sweltering hot summer day, I can hunch over my Brooklyn kitchen counter pantless, slurping somen noodles submerged in the icy stock. And this scenario is just as well-executed and satisfying with hot stock on a (slightly) less sweaty day.\r\nYou only need a handful of ingredients to make a great mushroom stock. First up, mushrooms (to state the obvious), which can be fresh or dried. I always use dried shiitakes for stock-making, only turning to fresh mushrooms in the form of stems, which I’ve saved when preparing fresh shiitakes for other dishes. (I store them in a gallon ziptop bag in the freezer, next to the bag of Parmesan rinds.) But if you want to buy fresh mushrooms for the purpose of making stock, a mélange, like crimini and shiitake, will do. Whether using fresh or dried, just remember that the ratio of ‘shrooms to water is 1 lb. fresh mushrooms or 2 cups dried shiitake to 2 quarts water.\r\nThe universal stock tenet applies to mushroom stock too: Scraps, like onion skins and butts and parsley stems, are your friends. So throw what you have in the pot. And whether or not you include veggie scraps, I advise that you add a sheet of kombu (a roughly 6\" piece will do) and a couple of peeled garlic cloves. If you eat fish, I also recommend adding 4 large dried anchovies (usually found in the freezer section of your Korean supermarket).\r\nBring everything up to a boil together, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, until the dried mushrooms and kombu have plumped and the stock is deeply brown from its ‘shroom infusion. After that, kill the heat and cool to room temperature. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then season with salt, soy sauce, and a dash of fish sauce, if you like.\r\nBeyond sipping your broth straight or pouring it over noodles, here are some more applications: Sneak a little bit into a miso-based salad dressing. Use it to make risotto or polenta (if you have those Parmesan rinds, throw them in while the grains cook, too). At my pop-up Doshi, I bloom wakame seaweed in rice vinegar and add it to a seasoned mushroom broth along with slivers of cucumbers. I freeze it before serving to create an almost slushy experience. It's the perfect hot weather antidote—and meat stock certainly can't say that."

      "content": "In the hierarchy of formal breakfast carbohydrates, French toast trails behind pancakes and waffles by a significant margin. You can’t blame the dish—it’s fighting an uphill battle: Waffles are fun! Pancakes are adaptable! French toast is… bread. Dipped in goop? You can understand why it’s taking up the rear—and why, at least in my mind, it is 100 percent a food you only make at home, never order in a restaurant. French toast is the best thing that almost-stale bread can become, but a “use it up” mentality isn’t the same as a “treat yourself” one. Despite it’s solid spot in the breakfast top three, plain French toast just isn’t that special.\r\nGrowing up, however, I did order French toast regularly at one establishment, a café and bakery in my hometown in Northern California called the Rising Loafer. The original location has since closed, but the space is still clear in my mind: butter yellow walls with fake cracks and vines painted on them, rows of crusty bread behind the cash register, and a big outdoor patio that was prime real estate on Saturday mornings. Without fail I would order the orange-raspberry French toast, made with thick slices of their house-made bread. The fruity flavors came from a glug of orange juice whisked right into the batter and a bright raspberry purée drizzled over the top—a combo that felt, despite its French toast base, very special indeed. I would also add butter and syrup (duh), then clean my plate of every last drop.\r\nI started re-creating the dish once I moved away from home but tweaked it ever so slightly: Because I never keep OJ in the house and always have a jar or two of Bonne Maman, I’ll whisk a big scoop of jam directly into the batter instead—a way to get the topping into the slice itself. The result is a sweet and subtly fruity dish, tinted ever so slightly by the color of the jam (though you can usually only see it once you cut inside). The sugar in the jam helps the outside of the French toast caramelize a bit more than your standard variety, and it almost doesn't need any extra toppings… though if you add butter and syrup, you wouldn’t be alone.\r\nMaking your own jam-infused French toast is as simple as whisking jam into your French toast batter, but there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, start with the custard mixture from your favorite classic recipe; one without any bells or whistles is ideal, and if you’re using a very sweet jam, omit the added sugar. Any flavor jam will work—I’ve tried berry, stone fruit, fig, orange marmalade, even pear and apple butter—as long as it’s not too chunky, since those bigger bits of fruit will get left behind in the batter bowl. I like to use 1 scant Tbsp. jam per egg in the custard, but your perfect ratio will depend on the brand and style you use. Give your jam a vigorous stir by itself first to smooth it out; if it’s really thick, whisk it with a teaspoon or two of warm water in a bowl to loosen the spread and help it integrate completely with the eggs and cream later on. Then add any ground spices and extracts you’d like: For berry jams, I’ll add a bit of vanilla extract to the batter; for stone fruits, just a smidge of almond extract; for orange marmalade, a sprinkle of ground cardamom.\r\nFinally, proceed as you would normally, giving your bread ample time to soak in the custard and plenty of fat to cook in. A little char and caramelization is natural thanks to the sugar in the jam, so keep an eye on your heat and how quickly the slices brown. I’m not saying this version will knock pancakes or waffles out of the breakfast baking top spot, but it at least gives French toast a fighting chance."

      "content": "After years spent lapping at flat whites spiked with sickly “nonfat” flavor syrups—one pump or two?—I graduated from university, landed my first Serious Journalism Job, and switched to Serious Brews Only. But now, in my tiny apartment kitchen, flavored coffee is undergoing a renaissance. I’m not talking about the bags of “caramel” grinds that leave a sort of soapy residue on the roof of your mouth. No, I’m talking about—endorsing, even—the simple act of adding spices to your coffee grounds.\r\nWhile adding spices to coffee has been a common practice for decades, if not centuries, in many parts of the world, including Morocco and Mexico, I first learned about it from my friend Maddie. One morning late last year, I woke up on the lofted bed in her living room to the unmistakable sound of whole beans jostling around in a bag. From my perch I watched her add them to a grinder followed by a few shakes of cinnamon and a pinch of salt (!). I thought I must be dreaming, until the guttural roar of shattering coffee beans woke me. I took a sip from the ceramic mug she handed over, and I’m telling you it was transcendent—like walking into a sunny clearing after a long hike through thick woods.\r\nI’ve obviously dumped as much stale cinnamon into my Starbucks orders as the next guy, but unlike those times, there were no weird, grainy floaties in my brew. And the addition of salt cut the perceived bitterness and acidity of the coffee and, much like it does in baked goods, amped up the sweet, floral flavor. Spicy coffee, as I’ve come to call it, is now the only way I’ll take my cuppa joe.\r\n<header>Here’s how to add spices to your coffee:</header>If you are decidedly not a morning person ( ✋), just add a sprinkle of preground spices directly into your French press, Chemex, Mr. Coffee—choose your own adventure—along with the ground beans. For the naturally peppy among us, you might prefer adding whole (as in, not ground) spices in with your whole beans and grinding them together. This will result in a more fragrant, aromatic brew, but be warned: Your bean grinder will likely hold on to those flavors and potentially infuse them into your next batch. Whichever route you choose, once the coffee and spices are combined, add a pinch of salt (though you might want to skip it if you love coffee’s bitterness), and continue to brew as normal.\r\nWarmer spices—the ones you’d reach for when baking—like cardamom, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, star anise, and cinnamon pair particularly well with coffee. Senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel loves New York Shuk’s Kafe Hawaij, a spice blend that was brought to Israel from Yemen and is traditionally used in fresh coffee. I’ll grind a tablespoon of cacao nibs with my coffee beans for a darker take on a mocha. And though it sounds a pinch deranged to me personally, people I don’t know on the internet have reportedly enjoyed adding dried culinary lavender to their grinds. (You do you.)\r\nWhatever you choose, know that a little spice goes a long way; my rule of thumb is ½ teaspoon ground spice per six cups of coffee. The best way to find what you like is to experiment with intensity and try to emulate your favorite baked goods (lookin’ at you pumpkin bread) in coffee form.\r\nWhile I’ve admittedly left the choppy mullet cut (moo-lay, as we used to pronounce it) back in my university days alongside literally everything I learned at journalism school, I’m delighted that fun, flavorful beverages are back in my life. Like a spicy coffee, I should have enjoyed those years while they lasted.",

      "content": "I used to buy bags of frozen tofu from the grocery store because I loved its satisfyingly chewy, spongy texture and its ability to soak up flavorful liquids like a sponge. I thought of it as a special tofu product—that is, until I learned that it is actually just…tofu that has been frozen. D’oh! \r\nDon’t get me wrong, frozen tofu is still a very special tofu product, just know that you can make it in your kitchen with almost no effort, no special trip to the freezer aisle required. Here’s how (and why) to freeze your tofu.\r\n<header>The freezer changes tofu.</header>When frozen, tofu magically transforms—its texture becomes denser and spongier, with tons of little coral reef–like holes. While I hate to spoil the fun, this magic is actually simple science: The water in tofu expands when it’s frozen, thereby destroying the original structure. When the ice crystals thaws, they seep out in the form of water, leaving the holes they formed behind. A star different tofu product with an entirely distinct consistency is born.\r\n<header>What’s good about frozen tofu?</header>This change in consistency makes the tofu simultaneously stronger, firmer, and spongier. It holds its shape better when cooked in stir-fries, hot pots, or soups, and loses its tendency to fall apart. Because the tofu has lost water and gained tons of little holes in its place, its mouthfeel is denser with a pleasant bite—some would say it has a meat-like consistency. \r\nThe holes are also perfect pockets for absorbing and storing flavor—like a sponge, frozen tofu is fantastic at soaking up sauces and broths. And, as with anything you freeze, you also extend your tofu’s shelf life—while tofu lasts for weeks unopened in the fridge, it will last for much, much longer in the freezer.\r\n<header>How do you freeze tofu?</header>It’s super easy to make frozen tofu at home. Simply cut whole blocks of tofu (any kind works, but be gentle with the silken stuff) into whatever size you plan on using (big or small cubes, thick or thin planks). Carefully place them on a sheet tray or in a freezer-safe container or bag. If you don’t plan on using all of the tofu at once, you’ll want to separate it into portions (use different bags or containers or layer with plastic wrap) so that you can defrost one helping at a time. After your pieces are frozen solid, about 4–6 hours, it’s done! Don’t worry if they’ve turned yellow—that’s completely normal. If you froze the tofu on a baking sheet, transfer it to a sealed container—it will last in the freezer for up to one year.\r\nSince your frozen tofu is already cut into pieces, you can either throw the cubes or planks directly into what you’re cooking or, if you don’t want excess moisture (say you’re planning to pan-fry, sear, or grill, or you’re simply wary of diluting a broth), you can thaw them before using. There’s no one right way to thaw—either transfer the tofu to the fridge overnight or run the pieces under water.\r\nFrozen tofu is great for braising, marinating, or simply adding to soups. And, in my humble opinion, a hot pot spread is simply incomplete without it. Speaking of which…"

      "content": "You cannot feel lukewarm about hot pot because hot pot does not feel lukewarm about you. Commonly found in East and Southeast Asian cooking, hot pot is centered around a vessel of roiling broth, into which diners plunk meats, seafood, vegetables, and starches. It’s a communal dining experience that calls for your attention and participation, as you throw handfuls of chrysanthemum greens or blocks of fish tofu into the broth. It demands that you be hospitable as beef slices reach peak medium-rare or thin rounds of potatoes soften to the perfect snappy texture—a signal for you to swiftly ferry them over to your fellow diners’ bowls. “Everyone is part of the journey with you,” says Eric Sze, the chef-owner of 886 and wenwen in New York City. “That’s why I love hot pot so much.”\r\nWhen he was growing up in Taiwan, Sze was surrounded by many different types of hot pot restaurants. But he was stunned to find virtually none in his college town of Ithaca, New York. A homesick student, he decided to make it himself for his then-girlfriend (now wife) with whatever meats he could find in the nearest grocery store’s freezer section along with Napa cabbage, lettuce, enoki mushrooms, and vermicelli. Immediately, he was hooked and started ordering hot pot at restaurants wherever he traveled and perfecting his own game at home. If you’ve made hot pot once, he explains, it becomes something you know and from there you can riff. “Every time, I pick up new things, like I’m going to try adding taro, or beef top blade instead of just short rib,” Sze explains.\r\nThat’s the beauty of hot pot: It’s choose-your-own adventure once you’ve learned the basics. And if you haven’t? Well, you’ve come to the right place. Welcome to our hot pot primer. Taking our lead from Sze, we’re sharing broths that’ll be the foundation of your meal, the perfect variety (and prep) of fixings to dip into those broths, gear that guarantees the smoothest hot pot experience, and our very chill rules to turning all these elements into the dynamic, delicious feast we love.

      "content": "For my entire cooking life, I took a kitchen-sink approach to broth. I grabbed the limp vegetables hiding in the crisper, the chicken carcasses and pork bones on the cusp of freezer burn, some chopped onions, and an old parm rind. I threw it all in a pot of water. I brought it to a simmer. I called it a day. This is a perfectly adequate approach, especially for any other cooks who straddle lazy and productive like me. And I was content to continue down this path of perfectly fine broth until I worked with Eric Sze, the chef-owner of 886 and wenwen in New York City, on this guide to hot pot.\r\nI snuck into the test kitchen while he and assistant food editor Jessie YuChen were cross-testing the broths for the story, and I was blown away by how delicious a vegetarian broth could be. I only slurped one spoonful, but even so I remember it clearly. It was unlike any broth I’d ever made: rich and deep with mushroomy flavor and distinctly herbal angelica root, thick and silken in texture like good tonkatsu, and rounded with a wisp of sweetness from rock sugar. I had a broth awakening.\r\n“Cooking is like building a house,” Sze told me later on. “You need to lay a foundation, then put down the bricks, the walls, the roof. Broth is very much the same thing.”\r\nFor him, broth isn’t a reactive response to what’s in your fridge but rather a proactive choice to build something delicious. This isn’t to say that making an intentional broth will require much more effort than what you are already doing. When you decide to make broth, you’re already committing a certain amount of time and energy—here, Sze focuses that time and energy so the final liquidy product is less shot in the dark and more bull’s-eye. Below are the techniques, tips, and mantras he relies on to make broths with a little more intent and a lot more flavor.\r\n<header>1. Pick your base ingredient.</header>Before you start cooking, figure out what kind of broth you want: veg or meat? Whatever you choose, make sure you get a variety of that base ingredient. That means, if you’re doing a mushroom broth, don’t just buy shiitake but also enoki, king oyster, and portobello. If you’re making tomato soup, turn to fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, and paste. For cabbage soup, seek out Napa cabbage, green cabbage, savoy cabbage, and Taiwanese cabbage. Or, if you’re craving a beefy broth, get several types of beef bones and cuts: shank, top round, even ground beef. “It adds another element,” Sze shares. “You want the same umbrella of flavor but different pockets and punches of that flavor.”\r\n<header>2. Then show it some TLC.</header>Once you’ve chosen your path, prep that base ingredient. For a veg broth, cook down the base ingredient in a pan (or roast in an oven) to sweat out all the moisture and concentrate the flavor. For a meat broth, Sze blanches the bones to clean them before adding to the broth. “That’s my Taiwanese heritage talking,” Sze says.\r\n<header>3. Unleash Maillard.</header>If vegetables or meat are your superheroes, aromatics are their trusty sidekicks. Sze’s favorites come from the allium family—onions, garlic, scallions, leeks—which he gives a rough chop and browns in a pan, a crucial step. This upgrades your already very flavorful and fragrant aromatics to Super Saiyan level (I’ve been watching a lot of anime recently). “Broth never exceeds 212°F, so you need to unlock the Maillard reaction in the aromatics before adding the liquid,” he says. “Sear them to get them golden brown, then drop them into liquid.”\r\n<header>4. Add depth beyond salt.</header>You’re likely already salting your broth, but you’re probably not adding Taiwanese rice wine, MSG, or sugar for depth. And I would say that these ingredients are where the magic of Sze’s mind-blowing broths lies. “I always reach for Taiwanese rice wine, which balances out any gaminess from meat and also works well for veg broths,” Sze says. Just as valuable and versatile is MSG, which brings umami to whatever it graces, and rock sugar, a staple pantry ingredient in many Asian households, including Sze’s. “It’s the same as cane sugar, and it’s inexplicable,” he explains. “I add in a little bit at a time, tasting as I go. The sugar accentuates whatever flavors you’ve already developed.”\r\n<header>5. Take your time.</header>“Time is the most expensive ingredient” is Sze’s mantra. Once you have all your ingredients ready—blanched bones or sweated-out vegetables, caramelized aromatics, rice wine, MSG, and sugar—add water and bring it to a vigorous boil. Then sit back and relax.\r\nVegetable broths come together quicker, usually around 90 minutes, whereas meat broths can take about 12 to 24 hours or until “the broth tastes pungent and not like tap water,” Sze says. Sure, you could try a pressure cooker, but Sze has misgivings. “It increases the pressure so that things cook faster, but it doesn’t release moisture,” and liquid needs to evaporate for flavors to concentrate, he says. Think about it: “Sun-dried tomatoes have intense tomato flavor because they’re totally dehydrated.” Anecdotally, any time Sze has tried to pressure-cook broth, it hasn’t come out as good compared to ye olde broth-making. “Not scientifically proven—just my personal opinion,” he adds.\r\n<header>6. Skim off the right stuff.</header>If you see any scum—those light brown, cloudy clusters of denatured protein—ladle it out. It’s not bad for you, just ugly. But hold off on skimming the fat. “Fat is your friend,” Sze says. “I like to fish out the fat at the end, so I can choose exactly how much fat I want in the broth. Any extra fat I keep for stir-fries.” Once the broth is done boiling, strain it, cool it, then remove as much fat as you want. All you’re left with is liquid gold.\r\nNow you’re ready for your own broth awakening."

      "content": "I never thought I would become a strong advocate for keeping a large batch of homemade croutons on hand. A crouton spokesperson, if you will. In fact, I’d never given that much thought to croutons at all. Sure, they may be a nice textural addition to salads and soups (we’re huge fans of Crispy Gone Soggy around here), but they’ve never been top of mind.\r\nBut the cheesy mustard croutons on Christina Chaey’s Creamy Cauliflower Soup changed my life mind. Those deserve more than a little hype.\r\nInstead of showering the cubed bread with dried onion or garlic powder (my default in the past) or taking a cue from the store-bought variety and turning to Italian seasoning, Chaey coats the croutons in Dijon mustard and shredded Gruyère or cheddar cheese before baking.\r\nMildly tangy mustard and buttery Gruyère are a perfect croque monsieur–esque combination (and a nice change of pace from typical crouton seasonings). When the two team up, they can give any stale or past-its-prime bread you have on hand a new lease on life. That loaf in the freezer you’ve been meaning to turn into breadcrumbs for weeks? Drench it in cheese, butter, and Dijon, crisp it up, and it’s ready to boogie.\r\n<header>Here’s how to make cheesy mustard croutons:</header>Combine 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, and 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard in a medium bowl and whisk to combine; season with salt and pepper. Add 5 cups country-style bread, preferably day-old, torn or sliced into 1\" cubes, and toss to coat in mustard mixture. Scatter ½ cup finely shredded Gruyère or cheddar cheese over, toss again to combine, then transfer croutons to a prepared baking sheet. Bake croutons at 350° until cheese is melted and crisp around the edges and croutons are golden brown and crunchy, 10–15 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Then it’s ready to shower over salads and soups galore.\r\nOf course you can use these as a topping on most creamy soups or hearty salads that play nicely with bold flavors and rich dressings, but that’s not all: These seasoned, flavor-packed croutons can also get folded into an eggy breakfast casserole in lieu of cubed bread or crumbled over firm whitefish like cod in place of breadcrumbs before baking. Or do what I did: Plow through half your stash by munching on them as a snack in the way you would cheesy crackers or chips. \r\nThat’s it—I have officially made a full transformation into a crouton hype-person."

Transfer steak to a platter and let rest 15 minutes for juices to redistribute.",

      "description": "Our better-than-ever broccoli cheddar soup recipe is lighter and brighter than some you may have had in the past. It boasts a creaminess that comes from blended potatoes and broccoli stalks rather than heavy cream or the roux that many recipes call for—which means that, minus the optional garnish, this creamy soup is also gluten-free. Grating a block of sharp cheddar is crucial for this comfort food classic as the preshredded stuff is often mixed with an anti-caking agent that can wreak havoc with the silky texture of this delicious soup.\r\nThe other main player in broccoli cheese soup is, of course, the green stuff. The broccoli florets play two roles in this recipe: Half are added to the puréed base lending it a verdant hue, while the rest are mixed in toward the end, offering a nice crunch to break up the richness. Finally, in a nod to crusty bread bowls, we’ve added cheddar-topped croutons to every serving.\r\nFor a dairy-free broccoli soup, check out Andy Baraghani’s recipe with turmeric, peanuts, and crispy shallots or Hetty McKinnon’s broccoli and cashew number for a cream of broccoli soup experience that is completely vegan.",

        "Melt 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and ½ tsp. red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper. Stir to combine, then cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, trim bottoms of 2 heads of broccoli, then peel. Separate hefty stalks from florets (the thin, little stalks attached to broccoli tops are fine to leave attached to the crowns). Set aside florets. Coarsely chop stalks into 1\"–2\" pieces. Peel 1 medium russet potato. Coarsely chop into 1\"–2\" pieces.",
        "Add broccoli stalks and potato pieces to pot and stir to coat in butter. Pour in 5 cups water, add 1 Tbsp. salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep at a simmer. Cover pot and cook until broccoli stalks and potatoes are completely tender (test with a cake tester, paring knife, or fork), 20–25 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, chop reserved florets into small pieces (you can take the time to separate them into baby florets or just have at them with your chef’s knife). Grate 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box grater. You should have about 2 1/2 cups.",
        "Add half of florets to pot, cover, and cook until bright green, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a blender, let cool for 5 minutes, and purée until smooth. Some blender advice: Don't fill your blender more than halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center lid from the blender and cover with a kitchen towel. Alternatively, use an immersion blender. Your soup won’t be quite as smooth, but it will still be great. Return purée to pot.",
        "Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot and cook until bright green, another 3–5 minutes. Add 2 cups cheddar cheese and stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to low; set aside while you make the cheddar croutons.",
        "Heat broiler. Broil 4 thick slices rustic white bread (if using) on a rimmed baking sheet until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread over (soft side up), then sprinkle with reserved cheddar cheese and a few flecks of red pepper flakes. Continue to broil until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 2–3 more minutes.",
        "Remove soup from heat and stir in ½ cup plain Greek yogurt. Season generously with black pepper; taste for salt.",
        "Cut cheese toasts (if using) into 1\" (spoon-sized!) pieces. Divide soup among bowls. Top with cheddar croutons or reserved cheese."

      "description": "Potlikker (or “pot liquor”) is the brothy, nutrient-dense liquid gold traditionally left behind after boiling greens and beans. An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of powerful flavor. In this herbaceous version, Hall doubles down on the fennel’s licorice notes by adding a glug of Pernod, an anise-based liqueur that’s a natural pairing with seafood and vegetables.\r\nUse this potlikker as a base for Hall’s Shrimp and Grits With Fennel Potlikker, her Lemony Spring Vegetable and Barley Bowl, or any dish that would benefit from an intensely aromatic broth.",

The result is a luscious sauce for coating a pot of pasta, as well as any “etceteras” from your holiday table: roasted brussels sprouts, sautéed green beans, cooked greens, and even cranberry sauce all make great additions.",

      "description": "This one-pot dish from chef Carla Hall is basically spring in a bowl, bursting with fresh asparagus, tender green peas, lemon, and mint. It’s important to buy pearl barley for this recipe: Compared to whole grain hulled barley, which is chewy and requires lots of cooking liquid, the pearl barley used here cooks in less time and results in a creamier texture (think arborio rice). Another quick-cooking grain like pearled farro would also work well here. Making Hall’s Fennel Potlikker is a crucial first step here, so be sure to read through that recipe first.",

I think zucchini might fit in here when my garden is overflowing with it in the summer, and I bet it would be great as a cold salad with some cucumber and feta added. I will be making this often!",

Pickled peppers are the secret star of this dish, lending acidity and just the right amount of heat to an otherwise rich one-skillet meal. (Don’t throw out the pickled pepper liquid—it makes a great addition to a vinaigrette or Bloody Mary.) The steak should be pretty rare when you shingle it over the vegetables, but don’t worry: After a few minutes under the broiler, it will be perfectly cooked.",

      "description": "Most permutations of cauliflower (roasted florets, cauliflower rice, yes, even cauliflower gnocchi) rarely tempt me. But when you simmer a whole head of cauliflower with onion, garlic, and half-and-half, then blend it all until thick and velvety, it makes a sublime creamy cauliflower soup that’s all the more remarkable because it's so quick to prepare. Half-and-half adds just the right amount of rich dairy flavor to help the cauliflower taste its best, but you could also use milk, heavy cream (or mix equal parts of both for DIY half-and-half), or plant-based milk. Don’t skip the white pepper or the fresh lemon juice—they’re the secret ingredients that’ll have you craving spoonful after spoonful. The cheesy mustard croutons on top offer an ideal mix of sharp and rich flavors, but this creamy soup would also be delicious topped with toasted sunflower seeds, a spoonful of chili crisp, or some pesto.",

Add 1 large head of cauliflower (2½–3 lb.), florets broken into small pieces, core chopped, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, ¼ tsp. freshly ground white or black pepper, and 5½ cups water (the water should just barely cover the cauliflower).

Husband kept naming other ways we could use the potlikker and son didn't say a word as he gobbled it all up. We love turnips and the only small ones I could find were purple, but they worked well. I would think any large turnip would also work, if cut to smaller pieces. Only wish was that I had also gotten a good loaf of crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce. Leftovers were great the next day as well. We'll be making this again!",

      "description": "Pho was the dish my family gathered around every Sunday, whether we were at home or at our favorite spot in Los Angeles’s Chinatown. Even as I started to cook more vegetarian food as an adult, my craving for a filling, soul-edifying pho remained, and I spent years chasing down the right combination of ingredients that would produce a vegan pho broth just as umami-packed as one with beef bones. Here I landed on a mix of dried shiitake mushrooms, kombu (dried kelp), and miso to bring a nuanced complexity to the broth. (Read more about how I developed the recipe here.)",

The spice flavours came through the strongest and to be honest I found them a bit odd, but maybe that's just me, it didn't have the depth of flavour I expected, or the umami flavour that I thought it would have and which I wanted more of. It was also, I thought, quite an expensive recipe (shiitake mushrooms, kombu), at least where I live, for very little payoff. I wouldn't make it again. ",

      "description": "Beef and daikon are a classic pairing in Asian soups. Daikon brings a pleasant sweetness to the broth—it’s so juicy and soft when done right—while beef contributes richness and depth. To make this soup, you’ll start with bone-in short ribs, separating the meat from the bones and browning both with aromatics to build deep caramelized flavor. Then you’ll deglaze the pot with rice wine and cook everything down with added spices. The end result is a comforting soup brimming with cubes of fall-apart beef and super tender daikon that will get you through the last leg of winter.",

      "description": "Moussaka might be the most famous Greek casserole, but it certainly isn’t the only one. Similar to Greek moussaka, pastitsio starts out with layers of spiced meat and gets finished with creamy, cheesy béchamel sauce before getting baked. Pastitsio, however, uses pasta, specifically the titular extra-large hollow noodles sometimes referred to as Greek macaroni (we love Loi brand). Bucatini will work in a pinch, as will Romano cheese subbed in for the salty, fragrant Greek cheese kasseri, which you can find at specialty markets.",

      "description": "This comforting hot pot base gets plenty of umami from mushrooms and alliums, which means there’s no need for meat. Chef Eric Sze of New York City’s 886 and wenwen likes pairing a mild, refreshing broth like this one with a spicier broth in a divided pot because switching between the two “makes your palate dance,” Sze explains. If you want to spice up this broth, however, you can add 4 Tbsp. Pixian chili bean paste and 15 dried chao tian jiao (or dried chiles de árbol) and cook for 2 minutes before adding the onions. Even if you aren’t making hot pot, you can use this broth as a flavorful (and vegan!) base for stews, soups, braises—or just something comforting to sip on.",

Preserved lemon, a pantry superstar if there ever was one, adds a brightness that cuts through the rich, stewy lentils. Because preserved lemons can vary in salt and acidity depending on the brand, you’ll want to adjust the amount of salt and lemon accordingly. As for the herbs, dill and basil work especially well in this soup, but you can use any tender herbs you have on hand. And if the toppers feel too involved for a Wednesday night (I get it!), feel free to spoon over a bit of your favorite store-bought chili crisp instead. ",

If anyone cares about their health, and I would think that people making these good recipes would be amount those people, it’s well known in food science that extra virgin olive oil makes free radicals which are not good for us when heated. Lighter olive oil is what we should cook with, saving extra virgin olive oil only for dipping and finishing off a dish that’s finished cooking, to add a little flavor. I’ve seen this knowledge repeated by Italian cooks on food shows where they are in Italy, so it’s not just American food science that has published this for quite some time now. Cook with light olive oil for your heath. Save your extra virgin for dressings and dipping. ",

Add 2 tsp. ground cumin and ¾ tsp. ground turmeric and stir to coat onions. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Add ½ preserved lemon, rinsed, seeds removed, finely chopped, and 3 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste is darkened in color, about 4 minutes.",

Aleppo-style pepper into infused oil in pan and set aside.",

It is NOT even remotely close to the real dish, which is absurdly simple, as shown in the actual ingredients list at the top of my post.

An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of meaty flavor. Here she makes potlikker with dry-cured country ham. If you can’t find country ham, smoked ham hocks will bring similar intensity.",

I also added extra ginger and a black cardamom pod for more depth and smokiness. I used a mix of whole milk and half and half for a thicker texture, too. I find the comment on 7/11/20 to be ignorant and an unfortunate example of how the noble intention to be inclusive can be warped into painful extremism. As a woman of color, I am repulsed by the thought that only people of a certain culture/ethnicity can be the voice for that culture, as if only Vietnamese people are ever allowed to present an \"authentic\" pho recipe - for example. Or that only an Indian staff-person at BA is allowed to present any Indian recipe. The maple syrup used in this recipe is obviously not traditional, but if one tries the substitution, one may find the flavor to be softer and richer than using palm or cane sugar.",

By starting the curd on the stovetop, you’ll ensure that it sets quickly when transferred to the oven, which will keep its texture soft yet sliceable. The secret ingredient—okay, it’s cream of tartar—provides a sour counterpoint that keeps these from being cloyingly sweet, and the buttery vanilla shortbread offers just enough heft to anchor the curd while still keeping the bars melt-in-your-mouth tender.",

Buttery crunchy crust, and I used 100% frozen passionfruit (Whole Foods sells in thee frozen fruit section ), as opposed to juice which is sometimes diluted with other juices, losing tartness. I wasn't sure why flour was used in the curd. I've made curd without it and it's perfect. Some small flour lumps remained which is possibly why this recipe calls for putting the curd through a sieve. This part added on much more time/work. If I make these again, I'm skipping the flour and saving the time, and I'm guessing they'll be just as good. Cant wait to serve them to end my dinner party this Sat! Thank you.",

Preserved lemons, when puréed into paste and incorporated into the simple batter, bring a powerful citrus flavor and subtle brininess that zest and juice alone could never achieve. Olive oil reinforces the fruity savoriness and works with the sour cream to keep this loaf plush and moist for days. (And before you worry, even though preserved lemons are salt-cured, the final product does not taste salty.)",

If you have an old oven like me, then you'll also need to increase the cooking temperature (325 F is just waaaay too low) . A big tip to know when it's done: if you see that the top is starting to change color (to a golden brown) take it out immediately! If you see bubbles then you might have over cooked it, it will develop a skin on the bottom that is not pleasant to eat (but the rest of the cake is still okay-just not ideal). I've made this a few times. Another tip while making the caramel, if you add more than 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, then flan will have more of a lemon drop flavor (which isn't bad, but it over-powers the coffee flavor). You could do a lemon-flavored flan with this method without the coffee beans. The flan will always have a dull gray-ish color to it, hence the coffee beans, (which is not typical for flans) but I don't think it takes away from the texture or flavor. It just looks unusual for this dish.",

Cook lemon juice, remaining ⅔ cup sugar, and ¼ cup water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Do not rush this step; if liquid boils before sugar dissolves, the caramel will never darken. Once syrup turns clear, stop stirring and increase heat to medium. Cook, swirling pan every few minutes, until caramel is deep mahogany and wisps of smoke appear. Immediately pour into pie dish. Quickly tilt pan to coat bottom and a bit of the way up the sides with caramel. Set inside a roasting pan or other ovenproof dish with high sides.",
        "Whisk eggs in a medium bowl to break them up a bit. Reheat coffee mixture until steaming, then pour into eggs, whisking constantly to combine. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into caramel-lined dish. Transfer to oven and pour enough boiling water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dish. Bake until custard is set but still jiggles a bit at the very center, about 1½ hours. Let cool in water bath 30 minutes. Remove dish, cover with plastic wrap, and chill crème caramel until set, at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.",
        "To unmold, run a thin-bladed knife around edges of dish, making sure tip of knife stays flush against bottom of dish. Invert a large plate over dish, then quickly flip. Slowly lift off dish; crème caramel should slide out. If not, tap plate against countertop until it does. Serve in slices with caramel spooned over."

      "description": "These cheesy, green-y, and utterly satisfying chickpea pancakes were inspired by Healthyish contributor Aliza Abarbanel’s favorite work-from-home comfort lunch. “I’ve filled these pancakes with just about every leftover in the fridge, from cooked greens to roasted mushrooms to marinated lentils, but melty cheese remains a constant,” she says. Gluten-free and packed with protein, chickpea flour pancakes come in many variations across the world, from Indian besan chilla to French socca to Italian farinata. If you don’t feel like or have time to make pancake batter during your lunch break (though we highly recommend it!) large flour or alt-flour tortillas work wonderfully as a substitute; just fold the cooked greens and cheese inside the tortillas and heat directly in the skillet to melt the cheese.",

At its core, it’s just tequila and Squirt [grapefruit soda]. That’s it. And that’s what makes it so great.” It’s rare to find a paloma listed on a bar menu in Mexico. They are simply part of relaxed social gatherings, where you set out tequila bottles on a table along with Squirt (and maybe an alternative of Topo Chico mineral water and a few limes to make a Ranch Water) for self-service. “When I want a paloma, I like that exact bracing taste and the sugar rush to go with the bold taste of tequila. Nothing compares.” There is nothing precious about pouring up a Squirt and tequila. It’s the equivalent of a basic rum and Coke.",

      "description": "It’s hard to resist the lure of crispy anything. Here, quick-cooking fillets of fish are slathered in a deeply flavorful combination of miso, butter, and panko, then broiled until the breadcrumbs form a toasty, golden crust. My days as a line cook at Perry St restaurant in New York inspired the technique behind this dish. It was my first job out of culinary school, and in the winter we’d make a similar dish using roast cod topped with a thin sheet of truffle butter reinforced with panko. This is an easier, far more accessible version that’s just as tasty. I use my preferred technique of cooking fish with the skin on (it holds the flesh together as it cooks) yet with no intention of getting it crispy—I just lift the fish away from the skin when it’s time to serve. I find that chasing crispy fish skin is a heartbreaking pursuit, so I don’t even bother. Besides, you won’t miss it with all the texture from the buttery panko business on top. ",

After reading the reviews, I only salted the asparagus lightly, spread a thin layer of the miso butter on the fish, and tossed the asparagus with less butter than pictured. The end result was delicious and different from anything I usually make. I didn’t find the flavour overpowering at all, I think in part because I used light miso, which is milder. I cooked the salmon for a bare 15 minutes and only had to broil for a minute and a half to brown the panko. Salmon was lovely; I think it helped that I got it to room temperature before cooking.",

        "Now, make the miso butter: Place 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power in 20-second intervals until melted. (Alternatively, melt butter in a small skillet over medium.) Add 6 Tbsp. white or yellow miso, 1 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. Sriracha, and 1 Tbsp. sugar. Smash and peel 9 garlic cloves. Finely grate on a Microplane into miso butter. Peel one 3\" piece ginger with a spoon; finely grate into butter. Stir to combine.",

        "Dollop about two-thirds of miso butter over fish, spreading it into an even layer with spoon. Sprinkle buttered panko over fillets and gently press with your hands to adhere. Roast fish and asparagus until fillets are firm when sides are gently pressed, 15–17 minutes. ",

      "description": "The key to an excellent whiskey sour? Getting the balance just right. This whiskey sour recipe has all the right proportions of bright, bracing lemon juice; warming, floral bourbon; and sweet simple syrup to deliver a refreshing cocktail that’s neither too cloying nor too biting. Using freshly squeezed juice is essential—the stuff that comes out of fruit-shaped squeeze bottles doesn’t even compare. If you don't have any lemon on hand, you can swap it out for lime (or a mixture of the two). Serve on the rocks with an orange wheel and a Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear (optional but recommended!), and enjoy. Cheers!",

I do add a pinch of sugar just to reduce some of the acidic taste from the tomatoes, but that’s what my mom always did, so perhaps it is fine without.

        "Fill a large stock pot two-thirds full with water and heat over high to bring to a boil. Once you see the water start to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt. We know, we know: That looks like a LOT of salt. But salting the pasta water aggressively—it should almost be seawater-salty—is the key to making sure that every noodle is properly seasoned through and through, and is one reason why restaurant pasta tastes better than the stuff you usually make. While you wait for the water, start your sauce.",
        "Open a 28-oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes and drain contents in a colander set over medium bowl. (Whole peeled tomatoes are the only canned tomatoes worth buying, TBH. The diced ones sometimes have weird chemicals added to them to keep the chunks from breaking down. Gross.) Using clean fingers, poke a hole in the tomatoes and shake to drain liquid and seeds from the insides of each tomato, reserving liquid. Shake colander over bowl to separate the solids from all the juices and encourage liquid to drain; set aside.",
        "Smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef’s knife forcefully, so garlic breaks up into smaller bits; remove skins. If the cloves are really big, you might need to give them an extra smack to make sure they're broken up, but don't bother chopping—the garlic will infuse into the oil you sizzle it in and break down as the sauce simmers.",
        "Working next to your pasta pot, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. (We like using a Dutch oven or a large, high-sided skillet for cooking sauce and finishing pasta; it's kind of the only thing big enough to toss a whole pound of pasta in without noodles flying everywhere.) Add garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all over, about 3 minutes.",
        "Stir in a pinch of red pepper flakes, then add drained tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. The idea here is to concentrate the flavor of those tomato solids before adding the liquid they came in, which will give your sauce a more complex, rounded flavor. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are darkened in color, browned and caramelized in spots, and starting to break down, 6–8 minutes. Don't rush this part! If you aren't getting color, let it go for another few minutes. Mash with the back of the wooden spoon to form a coarse paste.",
        "Add reserved tomato liquid to pot and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of salt, throw in 3 basil sprigs, and reduce heat so sauce is bubbling at a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, 8–10 minutes. If your water isn’t boiling yet, turn off heat under sauce while you wait. If it is, reduce heat to lowest setting and move on.",
        "Add 1 lb. pasta to pot of water and agitate with tongs to prevent sticking. Cook pasta, tossing occasionally, just until lower end of time range given on the package for al dente. If you're not sure if it'sdone, fish out a piece and take a nibble—it should still be slightly too crunchy to want to eat because it's going to continue cooking in the tomato sauce. Just before pasta is done, use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop out about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.",
        "Using tongs, transfer pasta from stock pot into Dutch oven with sauce, allowing water to piggyback on pasta into sauce. (That's right, no draining!) Crank heat under sauce up to medium-high and pour in ½ cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. If you'e never finished cooking pasta in a pan full of sauce, your life is about to be changed—this process is what ensures that every single noodle is completely coated and infused with saucy goodness, and is pretty much the main difference between a dish of \"meh\" pasta and one that blows your mind.",
        "Cook pasta, tossing constantly, until sauce is clinging to eah noodle and any standing liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 minute. You still want a saucy consistency, but not watery. If things ever start to look a little dry, just add another splash of that pasta cooking water; if they look too wet, just wait a bit for some more liquid to evaporate.",
        "Slowly sprinkle in half of the Parmesan cheese (you want the grainy stuff with the texture of shaky cheese, not Micropaned), tossing constantly, until it has melted into the sauce. Add more pasta water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, to loosen sauce if necessary—it should be plenty saucy while you're incorporating the cheese so it emulsifies into the sauce properly. You want the sauce to ooze but still be thick enough to coat the pasta.",
        "Remove pot from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. butter until melted. Finishing with a bit of butter is almost always a good idea—it makes the finished dish extra glossy and delicious. (Don't look at us like that—if youthink pasta is diet food, you're kidding yourself.)",
        "Using tongs, divide pasta among bowls, then top with remaining cheese and basil leaves. Top with red pepper flakes and an extra drizzle of oil, if you feel. And there you have it: saucy, glossy Basically Spaghetti Pomodoro. Give yourself a pat on the back, and kiss the jarred stuff goodbye."

Dark brown sugar is key (keeping the bread ultra tender and moist), and a dollop of mascarpone (which you can sub with sour cream or yogurt if desired) makes for superior tenderness in the crumb. Chocolate and walnuts are optional but encouraged, and if you like an extra crunch, follow former BA test kitchen director and cookbook author Carla Lalli Music’s recommendation and sprinkle the top with raw sugar just before you put the pan in the oven. Serve slices plain or slathered with cream cheese or butter.",

      "description": "This dessert could grace a pastry shop window, but its elegance masks its ease (just as the shiny chocolate glaze covers up the bouncy-cushiony-chewy middle). The mochiko, or sweet rice flour, is what gives the cake its unique texture, and the earthy matcha and bittersweet chocolate make it not too sweet. In the spirit of the Hawaiian butter mochi that inspired the recipe, it requires minimal equipment and comes together in the time it takes the oven to heat up. Do take the time to sift the matcha, however—it ensures that there aren’t any dry bits in the final cake—and splurge for ceremonial-grade matcha if you want the most vibrant color possible.",

He'll have to use each of his senses - other than sight. Does Chris have what it takes to recognize then reproduce this classic American comfort food with his eyes behind a blindfold?",
      "transcript": "Hi, it's Rhoda.\r\nAnd I'm here in the BA test kitchen\r\nto have a secret conversation about Chris Morocco.\r\nOnce again\r\nwe're putting Chris's super taster abilities to the test.\r\nThis is Carla Hall's chicken fried steak\r\nwith sausage cream gravy.\r\nI'm challenging Chris to recreate this dish\r\nusing every ingredient\r\nin just one day.\r\nHe'll be able to taste it, touch it, smell it,\r\nbut at no point will he be able to see this dish.\r\nAt the end of the day,\r\nwe'll be back to see his final creation\r\nand I'll be the judge.\r\n[intense music]\r\nOh, it's like a piece of bread,\r\nwith like pickle and like a little bit of onion.\r\nAnd then there's like, a crispy bit under there.\r\nBut it's like, is this a sandwich?\r\nTaste like raw onion, raw white onion.\r\nLike this doesn't,\r\nthis is not like, wonder bread right?\r\nThis smells like yeast, bread.\r\nFeels like it was probably toasted\r\ngetting a little bit of like a dried out sort of texture\r\nagainst the side of the bread.\r\nOh, geez.\r\nTook it clothes off here.\r\nVery crisp, breaded coating.\r\nWe could be getting a little bit of cayenne or paprika,\r\ngarlic and or onion powder,\r\nit's staying monumentally crispy.\r\nLike this is actually like a pretty intimidating\r\nbit of culinary magic kind of going on here.\r\nNow in something like a chicken cutlet,\r\nyou're very often gonna find an egg wash\r\nused as your liquid component.\r\nI don't know if that's super common\r\nwith what I think this is.\r\nA seemingly flat pounded piece of beef.\r\nAs it cooks, it kind of contracts.\r\nThose muscle fibers tighten.\r\nI'm a feeling like this really started out fairly thin.\r\nOkay, and now there's real situation happening here.\r\nWow.\r\nSo much [beep] black pepper in here,\r\nit's just like [imitates machine gun].\r\nTastes like sausage gravy.\r\nCould it be a breakfast sausage just with like,\r\nmassive application of black pepper\r\nand maybe some cayenne as well.\r\nI think this is chicken fried steak\r\nsuper American Southern.\r\nNot sure about the chef.\r\nThat's it for this tasting.\r\nAnd it is time to make a shopping list.\r\nJesus Christ at least yell action or something.\r\nWhat cut of steak\r\ndo you chicken fry?\r\n[Crew] And what is Chicken-Fried?\r\nWhy is it not Steak-Fried?\r\nI don't know.\r\nI don't know.\r\nOkay, shopping list.\r\nSirloin steak question mark.\r\nBut some options would be kind of awesome on this.\r\nButtermilk for the dredge.\r\nWe need some AP flour.\r\nLet's also get like some Wondra flour.\r\nIt's a flour made from like very soft wheat.\r\nOnion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne,\r\nbreakfast sausage, milk, cream.\r\nI don't think we need eggs.\r\nLike, can I just like, make that statement?\r\nThe truth is, I mean it's very hard to tell.\r\nIt didn't taste obviously egg-y,\r\nbut to what degree does like a chicken cutlet taste egg-y?\r\nAnyway, I don't know.\r\nFine, let's just get eggs.\r\nSo then we also need white sandwich bread,\r\nred onion, yellow onion,\r\nsour pickles.\r\nSomebody's gonna go out, shop these ingredients\r\nand I will have my first shot at the dish.\r\n[intense music]\r\nWe're gonna get the meat brining,\r\nassemble the dredge,\r\nand then we're gonna make the gravy.\r\nBefore we do that, somebody [beep] up.\r\nWhat's this, what's all this?\r\nLook at the last radius of the spatter,\r\noil all over.\r\nThis is almost certainly not a deep fried item.\r\nI mean, this whole thing could be a set up.\r\nThis could be one big [beep] brick\r\nin the set of the Truman Show that my life has become, okay?\r\nYou know where you have oil sloshed out of something?\r\nIt's when you fry something in cast iron but like, low.\r\nEverything's a [beep] clue.\r\nThat's why you smell the inside of the cloche,\r\nthat's why you lick the surfaces\r\nwhen you come into the test kitchen\r\nbefore the production team is here, okay?\r\n'Cause everything's a [beep].\r\nSo we're gonna start with meat.\r\nThis is sirloin steak, okay.\r\nAnd then this is a top loin steak,\r\nhas a little bit more intramuscular fat,\r\nalso looks just by its very nature,\r\na little bit more tender to me.\r\nThis to me looks like a top loin steak\r\nthat has been pounded out aggressively.\r\nLike Sam the Butcher style,\r\njust like sat there and like whacked away at it.\r\nYou know, while somebody waited in line.\r\nI wanna use this top loin steak.\r\nI'm cutting it in half just to give it a head start,\r\nbecause we want to end up in a very thin place.\r\nKeep it as even as I can.\r\nAnd then we pound.\r\nSpikey side of the meat mallet\r\nis gonna increase the tenderizing effect.\r\nIf you take this too far\r\nthe meat's just gonna start falling apart.\r\nThis is my one nice sweater.\r\nYou know, this is just too big.\r\nYou could easily turn this into two pieces,\r\nsomething like that, you know.\r\nI don't think there's any harm in doing a piece of top loin.\r\nAlso doing a piece of cubes steak.\r\nIt's like, this looks pretty damn good to me.\r\nLeaner, feels a little more tender.\r\nI'm gonna go with both of these\r\nand see how they are side by side.\r\nNow we're gonna move onto our buttermilk brine.\r\n[crew laughs]\r\nBig picture, the meat is ultimately gonna hang out\r\nin two different bowls.\r\nOne is going to contain a buttermilk brine.\r\nThe other is going to be the dry dredging mix.\r\nI'm just going to whack a bunch of this in here\r\nand I'm gonna season it up with salt and pepper.\r\nButtermilk helps tenderize meats because of the acidity\r\nwhich acts on the protein in the meat.\r\nCube steak is in.\r\nTop loin.\r\n[Crew] Top round.\r\n[beep] Top round, top cube.\r\nTop gun, greatest movie of all time.\r\nThat's the brine portion.\r\nThis is be the dredging mix.\r\nYou can use a range of ingredients in dried dredges\r\nflour being one of them.\r\nYou can also use starches\r\nfor like Korean style fried chicken.\r\nI feel like that is more of like a starch based coating.\r\nIt's like very thin, but very crispy.\r\nWondra flour does have a tendency to show up a lot\r\nin Southern foods.\r\nFlour is raw.\r\nPlease cook fully before enjoying.\r\nWow.\r\nIt's like what happened\r\nthat they had to start printing that on the box, you know?\r\nThey're talking about it mostly\r\nas being something to use in gravies.\r\nSo I don't know.\r\nShould we use it in the gravy?\r\nMaybe, like let's go for it and see.\r\nBut think that you'd wanna higher protein flour.\r\nSo I'm sticking with all purpose for that.\r\nLittle bit of cayenne.\r\nI feel good about onion powder, garlic powder.\r\nOnion powder gives earthiness, it gives umami.\r\nGarlic powder is really assertive.\r\nThey're not interchangeable for their fresh counterparts,\r\nbut they both do have like,\r\nwonderful transformative qualities.\r\nPaprika is gonna provide the ability\r\nto pick up like that color you probably want.\r\nGreat.\r\nAlso wanna do a lot of black pepper here,\r\nand then we need to put some salt in there too.\r\nSteak is staying in the brine until we're ready to fry.\r\nGot the dredge right here.\r\nJust putting those aside.\r\nThe main components that I was tasting in the gravy\r\nwere some kind of roux, thickened dairy,\r\nkind of fatty ground pork, and a lot of black pepper.\r\nI would probably expect to find some onion\r\nand probably some garlic in there as well.\r\nLike if it is a sausage meat that's in that gravy\r\nit's probably breakfast sausage.\r\nBut to be totally honest\r\nthere was so much [beep] black pepper in there.\r\nIt made me wanna sneeze immediately when I ate it\r\nI don't know that I would be able to say a hundred percent\r\nif it's like, ground pork or breakfast sausage anyway.\r\nI'm looking to put a little bit of color\r\non this ground pork,\r\nbring out as much flavor from it as possible.\r\nOne thing I really noticed with this gravy is that\r\nthe meat was broken up really finely.\r\nIf you try to break up the meat too quickly\r\nit kind of inhibits browning a little bit.\r\nLike, that's good.\r\nThat's where a lot of flavor's gonna come from.\r\nPut in the onion and garlic on top of that\r\nlet it sweat out and then build the sauce from there.\r\nCraving a little bit more fat from it.\r\nI'm just gonna go a little bit more oil.\r\nAnd this is where it's like\r\ndid I need more meat to create more fat?\r\nMight season this with a little bit of salt.\r\nWe're pretty much at the point where I think we\r\ncould introduce some black pepper.\r\nHave that fat,\r\nand the skillet is gonna help really kind of bloom\r\nand activate its flavor.\r\nMan, you smell it.\r\nWhew.\r\nThis Wondra flower is some wild stuff.\r\nIt feels coarser, almost a little bit semolina-like.\r\nA cup of milk here.\r\nAnd as it comes to a boil it's thickening.\r\nThis is pleasantly thick.\r\nNot [beep] bad.\r\nI'm gonna put it on the back burner so to speak,\r\nwe can move on to frying of the steak.\r\nSteak has been in the brine\r\nabout half an hour or so I'd say.\r\nSo I know about this,\r\nI've just never done it.\r\nHere's what I wanna try.\r\nI'm gonna take a couple tablespoons of this\r\nand put it in the dry mix,\r\nwhich is gonna create some of these kind of like,\r\nclumpy moments that are then gonna hopefully\r\nadhere to the steak.\r\nThat's our cube steak.\r\nPack on this mixture.\r\nGet as much of it to adhere.\r\nNext one, we're gonna actually season first.\r\nAnd this is the top round.\r\nGot like a pretty nice thick coating.\r\nThat's kind of what I'm talking about here.\r\nI'm not hating that at all,\r\nto be honest.\r\nI feel like we wanna get that into the oil at 360.\r\nWe're going in.\r\nBad idea to put these in the same time?\r\nProbably.\r\nI'm liking the color.\r\nI'm liking these ripples.\r\nAll this really violent bubbling make is making it look\r\nlike maybe not quite the level of adhesion\r\nI might need here,\r\nbut I don't know.\r\nMaybe it's gonna crisp up a little bit\r\nand solidify as it sort of cools.\r\nSo the look of this one\r\nwhich is the top round,\r\nlooks a little better to me.\r\nYou've got the gravy,\r\nlike a pretty tight little gravy situation here.\r\nI have my lightly toasted bread.\r\nYeah, this is round one.\r\nI'm not hating it.\r\nI feel like maybe drying off the steak a little bit more\r\nbefore putting it in the coating.\r\nI don't know.\r\nIngredients,\r\nI'll go with a 78%.\r\nThere could be more things in the brine, or not.\r\nI feel like there could be more things\r\nin the gravy, or not.\r\nTechnique I feel pretty good about,\r\na pounded steak, dredged, wet brine.\r\nI'd say like maybe an 86.\r\nIn terms of appearance,\r\nI feel like pretty good about that.\r\nI think it's like the right elements.\r\nMaybe even a 90?\r\nFlavor wise,\r\nI don't think I'm so far off.\r\nThe meat's like, pretty tender.\r\nI mean, it's not spa food, you know what I mean?\r\nMaybe an 85.\r\nFrankly, go with even more black pepper.\r\nAnd maybe we should do the touch\r\nof cayenne in there,\r\nand just wake everything up.\r\nSo that averages me out to an 85.\r\nOn this piece of paper are my actual scores.\r\nOoh.\r\nI'm actually looking pretty good on ingredients.\r\nTechnique is where I'm the shortest.\r\nMaybe it's not a wet brine,\r\nbecause I was a little bit upset\r\nby how much moisture was coming out of that meat, you know?\r\nIt didn't seem like it,\r\nbut trust me, I was feeling really upset.\r\nAlso curious about this 87 for appearance.\r\nMaybe I was wrong about the toasting of the bread.\r\nAnd wouldn't it just be some like,\r\nweird frigging Southern thing\r\nto just have a slice of un-toasted bread on there\r\nwith some pickles on top.\r\nI've got one more tasting of the original dish,\r\nand then I have one more shot to get it right\r\nbefore it has to be judged.\r\nI just wanna see how big this sucker is.\r\nWe're not quite edge to edge\r\non the plate here, but we're getting close.\r\nI'm gonna dig into the gravy here.\r\nWow.\r\nThere's just so much [beep] black pepper in this.\r\nJust so much black pepper in here,\r\nbut there also could be some cayenne,\r\ngiving just a little bit of a brightness,\r\nreally opening up the flavoring.\r\nYeah, there's this slight kind of like,\r\ngummy coating on the meat.\r\nWhat if it's a dredge, but split into two things.\r\nSo first the meat goes into the dry mixture,\r\nthen into egg,\r\nand then into\r\nthe dredge.\r\nThat's what I'm wondering.\r\nI feel good about the cube steak,\r\nbut I think we need to change up this process a little bit.\r\nMaybe it is about treating it a little bit more\r\nlike a cutlet of sorts.\r\nAnd then the bread.\r\nYeah, I don't think the bread was toasted.\r\nDefinitely some changes to be made here\r\nin terms of my technique.\r\nAnd I've got one more shot to get this right\r\nbefore I have to put this up for judging.\r\n[intense music]\r\nSo last time we made a buttermilk brine that the meat sat in\r\nbefore going into the dredge.\r\nThis time we're just making a dredge,\r\nwe're gonna put egg as our wash,\r\nand then the meat is gonna go dredge into the egg,\r\nand then from the egg back into the dredge,\r\nand that's it.\r\nI don't really know\r\nthat I'm gonna make changes with it so much.\r\nI like the paprika.\r\nI like garlic and onion powder.\r\nI like the little bit of cayenne,\r\nand I like the black pepper.\r\nI like the black pepper.\r\nI like the,\r\nah, there we go.\r\nDidn't feel like there was anything that was like,\r\nbig smoking gun I needed to take out.\r\nI think the buttermilk brine was introducing a little bit\r\ntoo much moisture.\r\nI'm really just doing the egg instead.\r\nAnd maybe that's gonna give me a little bit more\r\nof that crispiness I'm looking for\r\nand a little bit more of that adhesion as well.\r\nWanna let this stuff sit while I work on the gravy.\r\nI really didn't taste onion and garlic in the gravy.\r\nI just feel like they're there.\r\nIt's honestly hard to taste anything\r\nother than black pepper.\r\nI was clearly off by a number of points\r\nin terms of my ingredient score.\r\nI do think and have said from the beginning\r\nthat this could be breakfast sausage here\r\nbreakfast sausage is introducing a little bit of sweetness\r\nin the form of sugar in this case,\r\nsometimes it might be maple syrup\r\nolive oil feels wrong.\r\nSo I'm just sticking with veg oil here.\r\nLook at the increased browning on the meat,\r\nthe sugar caramelizes.\r\nYou can expect like,\r\na slight kind of deepening of flavor\r\nand maybe just an overall intensifying.\r\nIt's almost to the point where\r\nI just don't think we have to like,\r\ndo the whole thing with the aromatics and all of that.\r\nI think we're gonna get like quite a bit of flavor here.\r\nThrow the black pepper in now.\r\nToast it out.\r\nI'm feeling good about the amount of fattiness\r\nthat's in here too.\r\nSo that's the milk going in.\r\nI'm going with Cayenne.\r\nNow I'm not trying to make it like, overtly chilli spicy.\r\nI just wanna really kind of brighten\r\nand lift the flavor a little bit.\r\nYeah, the cayenne just like,\r\nrounds out all those edges of the black pepper,\r\nwakes up the flavor.\r\nLike I actually feel pretty good\r\nabout the flavor at this point.\r\nAll right, so we wanna get the meat going.\r\nI want to go bigger than I had last time.\r\nI probably want to, you know,\r\nhave it be a little past the edge of the plate\r\nknowing it's gonna shrink up.\r\nSo we're gonna go salt and pepper.\r\nGoing in the dredge here.\r\nNow it's going into beaten egg.\r\nThis is gonna do a similar thing,\r\nhopefully that the buttermilk was doing,\r\nbut also introduce less moisture.\r\nBack into the same dredge.\r\nI don't know.\r\nIt's like that fourth beer, you know, probably a bad idea\r\nbut damn, it kind of feels good at the time, you know?\r\nLike that's kind of, that's kind of cool.\r\nAll right, so one piece of meat going in,\r\nand I hope it works out.\r\nI think the dry, wet, dry process,\r\nlike did us some good here,\r\nit tightened up, you know, as expected.\r\nBut I think we've got overall\r\njust a much crispier aspect to this.\r\nYeah, I'm feeling good.\r\nCan you cut out the part where I said\r\nit was not in fact Wonder bread?\r\nThank you.\r\nSubtle changes\r\nbut hopefully important ones and correct ones.\r\nIf I was at an 83 before, in terms of my own self score\r\nI would say I'm at a 90.\r\nGoing hard.\r\nTechnique is where I suffered the most.\r\nI don't know.\r\nLet's go with 85 on technique.\r\nAppearance, I was looking pretty good before.\r\nOh, let's go with a 90.\r\nI had a little taste of the gravy,\r\nso I think we're knocking on 88.\r\nThat brings my average to an 88.\r\nThis is a dish that Rhoda,\r\nI'm just gonna guess knows intimately.\r\nIt's a bit of a dangerous game here.\r\nHey.\r\nHello.\r\nWeren't you supposed to have a day off today?\r\nI came in just for you Chris.\r\nThat's what makes me nervous.\r\n[Rhoda laughs]\r\nWho made this and what did they make?\r\nI called this chicken fried steak.\r\n[Rhoda] With?\r\nWith sausage gravy.\r\nAnd who do you think created this deliciousness?\r\nI don't know.\r\nI never know.\r\nChris, may I present Carla Hall's chicken fried steak\r\nwith sausage cream gravy.\r\n[beep] I literally have like,\r\nspoken to Carla Hall on the phone like,\r\ntwice in the last month.\r\nLooking at the blondness,\r\nthe cutlet is really kind of like,\r\npresenting fairly different.\r\nI think the biggest win of all was\r\nnot toasting the bread the second time around.\r\nYou ever had barbecue?\r\nYeah.\r\nThis like a very common thing to find on a plate.\r\nOkay, yep.\r\nOkay, yeah, that's fair.\r\nI didn't, I wouldn't have like, yep.\r\nI didn't, yep.\r\nYou nailed the seasoning mix.\r\nHowever she seasons the meat.\r\nThen it goes into corn starch.\r\nI could see that giving you\r\nthat really nice level of adhesion.\r\nCan I honestly sit there and say\r\nthat I taste onion powder versus garlic powder?\r\nWe're expecting you to be able to say that.\r\nYeah, no, well I can't.\r\nSo I mean, cancel the show,\r\nlike I can't.\r\nAnd then you said you had buttermilk first.\r\nAnd then I went to egg.\r\nOkay, so she actually does both,\r\nthen AP flour and rice flour.\r\nThe rice flour would account for some\r\nof the Supreme sort of crunchiness on the exterior.\r\nAll right, let's talk about your gravy.\r\nWhy did you choose Wondra flour?\r\nIt said right on the tin that it excels in gravies\r\nand soups.\r\nOkay, I can't wait to do a side by side tasting\r\nbecause this is just regular flour.\r\n[beep] .\r\n[Rhoda] Breakfast sausage, correct.\r\nMilk, correct.\r\nLots of pepper.\r\nIs there cayenne in there?\r\nYes.\r\nI'm pretty impressed by your gravy.\r\nI think you were almost there.\r\nYep, okay.\r\nYou got the bread.\r\nWhat kind of onion did you choose?\r\nYellow. This was white.\r\nIt tasted so punchy that onion.\r\nYou know, what's so fascinating about this?\r\nLike, look at how the shell of Carla's stayed intact\r\nand the meat shrank away from it.\r\nI think it's that combination of starches, yeah.\r\nIt truly created like, an architectural shell.\r\nAre we tasting the original or mine?\r\nLet's do the original first.\r\nMmm,\r\nso good.\r\nI love it.\r\nSo peppery.\r\nIt's so peppery.\r\nIt's delicious.\r\nOkay, let's try yours.\r\nMm.\r\n[both laughing]\r\nI don't need your pity.\r\nIt's good, but the seasoning is like,\r\nreally good in Carla's.\r\nNo offense.\r\nYours does taste very similar though.\r\nI think I'm very happy with my gravy.\r\nIt's good with pickle.\r\nGood with wonder bread too,\r\nbut it has to wonder bread.\r\nEverybody knows that.\r\nAre you ready for your score?\r\nYeah.\r\nFor ingredients, you gave yourself a 90.\r\nI'm gonna go with 85,\r\nmostly because of the starch situation.\r\nYep.\r\nFor technique, you gave yourself an 85.\r\nUh-huh.\r\nI'm gonna go with 84.\r\nOkay.\r\nI'm really glad you got to the dry, wet, dry,\r\nfrom your first round.\r\nI think that was like really key in getting\r\nthe coating that you wanted.\r\nAppearance, you gave yourself a 90.\r\nI'm gonna give you a 95.\r\nOoh.\r\nI think it looked really good.\r\nAt least like visually,\r\nnailed that side of things.\r\nAnd finally, taste.\r\nYou gave yourself an 88.\r\nTasted really similar to the original,\r\nbut Carla is just a bit more aggressive with that seasoning.\r\nOn the steak, yeah.\r\nSo I'm gonna go with an 85.\r\nOkay.\r\nThat brings your total score to 87.\r\nOkay.\r\nI don't get a whole lot of B pluses in this game, so.\r\nI think you should be proud for just being you, Chris.\r\nFor just getting out of bed,\r\nand putting one foot in front of the other,\r\nshowing up.\r\nSoldiering on.\r\n[Rhoda laughs]\r\nI like this dish, you know why?\r\nBecause there's some hidden depth to it\r\nthat really make it unique and singular.\r\nSo fascinating and gratifying to be put into\r\nsome other chef's clogs\r\nto have to see through their perspective and their context.\r\nAnd this was no exception."

      "transcript": "I'm Anna Parsic. [upbeat music]\r\nI've been baking since I was eight years old.\r\nAnd today I'm going to fill, stack,\r\nand decorate a five tier wedding cake.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nToday we're starting with our cakes that are already baked.\r\nThis is a white vanilla butter cake.\r\nWe're using a high ratio cake,\r\nwhich will provide the support to stack five tiers.\r\nI'm using this tool to make sure\r\nthat both layers are equal in height.\r\nThis is a cake leveling tool that we design\r\nto make it easier to make the tiers even.\r\nScoring the cake allows me to cut it flat.\r\nEach of our cake tiers requires four layers of cake.\r\nTo do this, we bake two pans of cakes\r\nand cut them both into equally sized layers.\r\nThis is basically like preparing your canvas\r\nbefore painting.\r\nIf your canvas is not perfect,\r\nyour painting will not look right.\r\nIt's really important that your cakes are perfectly level.\r\nThis wedding cake has five tiers.\r\nAnd if one of the tiers is uneven, you will be able to tell.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nHere are the four evenly cut layers.\r\nThe next thing we're gonna do is fill the layers.\r\nThe first thing I'm going to do is put buttercream\r\non my board to hold the cake tier in place.\r\nThis is a traditional vanilla buttercream.\r\nThis is a simple syrup to keep the layers moist.\r\nThe boards support not only the tier itself,\r\nbut the tier that will be stacked\r\non top of it via wooden dowels.\r\nI'm putting a ring of buttercream\r\naround the outside of the cake.\r\nI'm going to fill it inside with a strawberry mousseline.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI'm going to repeat this process two more times.\r\nOn the second tier, I'm just going\r\nto use the vanilla buttercream.\r\nThis is a classic buttercream recipe.\r\nIt is very light and not overly sweet.\r\nThe main two ingredients\r\nare whipped egg whites and whipped butter.\r\nIt is important to use a butter based buttercream\r\nwhich has the ability of staying soft\r\nwhile at room temperature.\r\nWhich allows me to shape it well to create a smooth surface.\r\nAnd also will get hard when refrigerated.\r\nThis is important because when you apply the fondant,\r\nthe buttercream has to be hard.\r\nI always use the bottom of the cake tier facing the top.\r\nI do this because it's a more even surface\r\nto finish my cake.\r\nOnce all my cake layers have been stacked,\r\nI'm gonna do a crumb coating.\r\nA crumb coating, it's a thin layer of buttercream\r\nto make sure that you seal in all the crumbs.\r\nThis is a process that takes a long time to master,\r\nbut I've been doing this for 18 years.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nTo make sure that none of the crumbs are showing through,\r\nI apply another layer of buttercream.\r\nThis also helps with the structure of the cake.\r\nI keep leveling the cake with my offset spatula,\r\nbut it's a very soft touch.\r\nAnd I keep rotating the cake to make sure\r\nthat I make as evenly as possible.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nThis cake has been filled and given its rough shape.\r\nFor the next step, I need the cake to be firm.\r\nSo I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator for a little bit.\r\nThe cake has been in the fridge for about 30 minutes.\r\nIt is now firm enough for me to give it's final shape.\r\nTo do this, I'm going to add a little bit more buttercream.\r\nI'm doing this just to correct any imperfections.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI want the sides of the cake to be square,\r\nand I'll know I'm finished\r\nwhen the cake has a 90 degree angle all around.\r\nI use this leveling tool to confirm that.\r\nThis is our cake tier that has been filled\r\nand finished in buttercream.\r\nNow we're going to apply the fondant.\r\nWe use fondant to cover our cakes.\r\nFondant is a sugar based paste.\r\nFirst I sprinkle a generous amount of confectioner's sugar\r\non my table, and I will start rolling it out.\r\nI want to make sure that it's circular and even,\r\nso I'm rolling it out in every direction.\r\nYou can do so much with fondant.\r\nYou can mold it, paint on it, can make flowers.\r\nThis cake tier is nine inches in diameter,\r\nand about five inches high.\r\nSo I'm looking for a piece of fondant\r\nthat is about 19 inches.\r\nI roll the fondant into my rolling pin,\r\nand then I'll unroll it onto the cake.\r\nOnce on the cake, I will start smoothing it out.\r\nI'm using these tools. They are called fondant smoothers.\r\nThey basically act as my hands.\r\nOnce I apply the fondant onto the cake,\r\nI smooth it out to make sure\r\nthat I don't have any air bubbles.\r\nI don't want to leave any dents on the cake.\r\nTo be successful in this step,\r\nyour cake has to be very cold.\r\nI know it looks easy,\r\nbut it's very difficult to master this step.\r\nOne of the reasons people fail\r\nis because their cake, it's soft.\r\nThe fondant will amplify any imperfections in the cake,\r\nwhich is why we took so much time making it very even.\r\nThen I keep it smoothing out,\r\nalternating between my hand and the fondant smoother.\r\nThis tier is finished. It's been wrapped in fondant.\r\nI've also done the same steps on four other tiers.\r\nNow we're gonna stack our tiers.\r\nI'm going to apply a layer of royal icing to a cake board\r\nthat has been covered in fondant.\r\nRoyal icing will serve as our glue\r\nto make sure that the cake tiers don't move around.\r\nThe bottom tiers of the cake can be very heavy.\r\nSo my daughter, Sarah, is going to assist me.\r\nRoyal icing, it's a mixture of egg whites and powdered sugar\r\nthat has been whipped to a stiff consistency.\r\nI take one dowel, and insert it in the cake.\r\nAnd I marked at the top.\r\nAnd then I use that as a guide to mark my other dowels.\r\nI cut them and then insert them in the cake.\r\nI try to place the dowels,\r\nnot all in the centers of the cake.\r\nThat will give more stability.\r\nAfter I insert the dowels,\r\nI put another thin layer of royal icing,\r\nand then I stack the next tier\r\non top very carefully using a spatula,\r\nnot to damage the sides of the fondant.\r\nEvery time I stack a tier on top of each other,\r\nI use a bubble level to make sure\r\nthat the tiers are perfectly even.\r\nI'm going to repeat this process for each tier.\r\nNow I'm going to insert a longer, sharpened dowel\r\nthrough both tiers all the way through the cake board\r\nto make sure that the cake doesn't shift.\r\nIt's funny to be using a rubber mallet\r\nto work on a wedding cake,\r\nbut it's actually the best tool to use for this purpose.\r\nI'm making sure that the top tier is centered.\r\nSo I make minor adjustments using my fondant smoothers.\r\nWe use wooden dowels as support for our tiers.\r\nAt the wedding, when the cake sits for long hours,\r\nthat buttercream will start to soften.\r\nEach tier is supported by the wooden dowels\r\nin the tier below, so the cake doesn't settle.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nThe last dowel goes straight\r\nthrough the middle of the top tier.\r\nAfter I insert the last sharpened dowel,\r\nI covered the little hole with a piece of fondant,\r\nand then smoothed it out.\r\nAll the cake tiers have been stacked,\r\nand the dowels have been inserted.\r\nNow we're gonna start decorating.\r\nFirst, we're gonna add our borders.\r\nI have my 50/50 gum paste fondant mix.\r\nThe reason I use a 50/50 mix for the borders,\r\nthe addition of gum paste helps border retain its shape\r\nwhile molding it, because some fondant is really soft,\r\nand gum paste, it's a stronger paste.\r\nAnd I'm just pressing with my rolling pin to make sure\r\nthat I get the impression.\r\nI smoothed it out flat against the edge of the mold.\r\nI'm going to put this border on the bottom tier.\r\nI like using the widest border at the base.\r\nI make my own molds.\r\nA lot of my molds are actually trims\r\nfrom dollhouse catalogs.\r\nThis helps me differentiate myself\r\nbecause I keep my cakes unique,\r\nand they are not the standard process\r\nthat you might find commercially.\r\nThis cake has three different types of molds,\r\nbut the process is the same for all of them.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nHere we have our finished borders.\r\nNow I'm going to paint them.\r\nI'm using gold dust and lemon extract.\r\nIf you don't have lemon extract,\r\nyou could use vodka as well.\r\nI'm painting the borders on this cake gold.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nAfter we paint them,\r\nthese borders will be dry in a couple of minutes.\r\nThe alcohol will evaporate very quickly.\r\nThese are the painted borders.\r\nNow we're going to apply the borders to the cake.\r\nBefore I apply the border,\r\nI use a small brush and apply a very small amount\r\nof water to make the fondant sticky.\r\nThe borders on the cake can be very long.\r\nSo, Sarah's gonna help me apply them.\r\nSometimes a single border is not enough\r\nto go around the whole tier,\r\nso I need to attach several pieces together.\r\nI try to put the border seams in the back of the cake\r\nso they are not as noticeable.\r\nMost of the times a cake has a back and a front,\r\nunless specifically the client has told you\r\nthat the cake will be in the center of the room.\r\nI decide what the front of the cake will be.\r\nIf I'm doing some pipe work,\r\nI try to do the nicest piping work,\r\nor the biggest area that is being decorated in the front.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI also use a pairing knife to trim any excess.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nHere's the cake with the borders attached.\r\nThe next step is piping.\r\nHere, I have a piping bag that is filled with royal icing.\r\nThe royal icing, it's a very thin consistency.\r\nI use a very fine tip as well.\r\nIt's a 1.5 tip.\r\nWhen I'm doing this type of piping,\r\nit's called brushed embroidery.\r\nIt's just a free hand style.\r\nIt's a technique where you use royal icing to pipe a design,\r\nand then use a wet brush to make strokes.\r\nYou have to do this very fast\r\nbefore the icing dries on the surface.\r\nThe texture this technique achieves\r\nreminds me of oil painting.\r\nI really enjoy using this technique\r\nbecause it reminds me of my background in the fine arts.\r\nIt's just like drawing and painting.\r\nMy designs vary, but I always draw inspiration\r\nfrom the weddings, whether it be a beautiful lace\r\nfrom the bride's dress, the invitations,\r\nor sometimes even the moldings at the venue.\r\nA lot of people use templates,\r\nor draw the design on the cake before piping.\r\nBut I find that I do my best work when I do it free hand\r\nbecause that allows me to be organic with my designs.\r\nSo here's our piped cake.\r\nNow we're gonna add color to the design.\r\nSo the food colors that I use are called pearl dust,\r\nand they come in many, many colors.\r\nI call it makeup for cakes.\r\nI mix a small amount with clear alcohol\r\nwhich evaporates really quickly.\r\nSo it won't melt the icing.\r\nWe use alcohol because if you use water,\r\nit will dissolve the royal icing underneath.\r\nI'm just quickly apply a little bit of color,\r\nsome pearl, a light pink, and a gold detail\r\nto some of the piped embroidery.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nThis is a painted cake.\r\nSo now we're gonna make our decorations.\r\nWe're using the same mix 50/50 fondant and gum paste.\r\nI'm gonna start by applying a little bit\r\nof corn starch to the mold.\r\nThen I take a piece of my 50/50 gum paste fondant mix,\r\nand I push with my fingers\r\nto make sure that I get all the detail.\r\nAnd then I take a pairing knife to cut all the excess.\r\nCarefully, turn the press upside down and remove the piece.\r\nI use a brush to apply a small amount of corn starch.\r\nFor the second decoration,\r\nI'm using a double-sided press.\r\nPress to make sure that all the detail\r\nis imprinted onto the paste.\r\nThen I remove all the excess around the sides.\r\nSymmetry is very important for my cakes.\r\nThis collar aids me in keeping the decorations\r\nequal distance from each other.\r\nI'm poking holes to mark where the pieces will go.\r\nThis tier will take about 10 of each mold.\r\nI'm using water here to attach the decorations\r\nto the sides of the cake.\r\nI bend the pieces a little bit to form a garland shape.\r\nI use a needle tool to press the decorations\r\nagainst the cake.\r\nThese molds are very delicate,\r\nso I'm being very careful to not disturb the design\r\nwith my fingers. [peaceful music]\r\nNow I'm adding the lace pieces in between the garlands.\r\nNow that the lace pieces are attached,\r\nI'm done decorating the second tier.\r\nI'm also adding molded pieces to the fourth tier.\r\nThe technique used to make these pieces\r\nis the same technique used to make the pieces\r\non the second tier.\r\nI use royal icing as a glue for these pieces.\r\nBecause there's less surface area,\r\nthey might fall off if I just use water.\r\nI'm also going to use royal icing to pipe some stems\r\nbetween the decorations. [peaceful music]\r\nNow I'm going to add the side decorations\r\nto the bottom tier.\r\nFor this tier, I have a general idea\r\nof where I want the decorations to go.\r\nBut what I'm really trying to achieve is\r\nto place them to create balance.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nOn this tier, I'm also going to add some piping details,\r\nbut I'm going to switch the tip to pipe the [indistinct].\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI've attached all my molds and finished my piping.\r\nNext, I'm going to show you how\r\nto make two different types of flowers.\r\nI'm going to show the sweet pea and the rose.\r\nThe sweet pea's a very delicate flower.\r\nThis is a one or two out of five on a difficulty scale.\r\nSugar flowers can take weeks to create.\r\nThe base for our sugar flowers is gum paste.\r\nThis will become the center of the sweet pea.\r\nThen I take a covered wire, I dip it in the glue,\r\nI insert the wire into the disc.\r\nOne sweet pea flower consists of one stem,\r\none center, and two petals.\r\nNow I'm gonna cut the sweet pea petals.\r\nI take the cutter and press firmly with my palm\r\nto get a clean cut so there are no rugged edges.\r\nTo give the petals the right texture,\r\nand to get a more natural look,\r\nI'm gonna use a flower press.\r\nI use the same press for the inner and outer petals.\r\nNext, I'm gonna use a ball tool to thin the petals,\r\nand give them a ruffled look.\r\nAnd you need to apply firm pressure.\r\nI've been making sugar flowers for over 18 years,\r\nand I have invented some of my own techniques.\r\nIt's something that comes natural to me,\r\nand I can even create my own fantasy flowers.\r\nAnd sometimes people confuse them for real flowers.\r\nThen I use a needle tool to mark a line\r\nacross the center of the inner petal.\r\nThis will be attached to the center.\r\nNow I apply a small amount of glue\r\nto the center of the petal.\r\nThen I'll wrap the petal around the center.\r\nOnce a petal is wrapped around the center,\r\nI hang it on a wire rack to dry.\r\nWhile the paste is still flexible,\r\nyou can add some movement with your fingers\r\nso they're not all drying in the same shape.\r\nI'm also going to score the outer petal.\r\nApply a small amount of glue.\r\nOnce the inner petal has dried,\r\nwe can attach the outer petal.\r\nI try to make them each unique.\r\nJust as in nature, no two flowers are the same.\r\nNow I can put the flower upright in a former to dry.\r\nWell, now it comes a fun part\r\nwhich is the coloring of the flowers.\r\nThis is one of my favorite parts\r\nbecause this is when you really\r\ncan bring the sugar flowers to life.\r\nFor the sweet pea, I just use green and then pink.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI'll then attach three to five of these flowers\r\nto complete one stem.\r\nI use a nontoxic floral tape.\r\nThis is a finished sweet pea.\r\nNow I'm going to show you how to make a rose.\r\nThe rose is probably a four or five on the difficulty scale.\r\nIf you can master the rose,\r\nyou can probably make any flower in sugar.\r\nI take a small piece of gum paste,\r\nform into a ball, and then I use my palms\r\nto shape it into a cone.\r\nThis rose has four different layers and a calyx.\r\nThen I take an 18 gauge wire,\r\nand use a plier to make a small hook at the end.\r\nThe hook is something I do to help that wire stay in place.\r\nThis should be set aside to dry overnight,\r\nbut I'm going to continue working with a center\r\nthat I pre dried.\r\nI'm doing the outer petal layer first\r\nbecause it requires some drying time.\r\nSame as a sweet pea, I'm going to add texture to each petal\r\nby using a silicon press.\r\nIn reality, to make a rose, you really need two days.\r\nYou can't finish a rose in one day\r\nbecause you need drying time between the layers of petals.\r\nSo that's something to keep in mind\r\nwhen you are working on a wedding cake.\r\nThen I'm gonna use a ball tool\r\nto thin the edges of each petal.\r\nLike the sweet pea, these petals are cut\r\nfrom a thin sheet of gum paste.\r\nNow I'm going to use a knitting needle\r\nto curl the edges of each petal.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nNow, place the petals upside down on spoons to dry.\r\nThis is the second layer.\r\nIt's the same process.\r\nI thin the edges with a ball tool.\r\nThird layer.\r\nNow I'm making the first layer of the rose.\r\nI put a small amount of glue,\r\nand I attach the petals to the center.\r\nI make sure the petals are overlapping,\r\nthat's the key to making this type of rose.\r\nI attach the first petal halfway through,\r\nand then I take the other petal and insert it in between.\r\nI want my center to look tight and close,\r\nlike a natural rose would look like.\r\nEven though this is a simple rose,\r\nit's still very complicated.\r\nThis curl is much tighter than the outer layer.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nI'm constantly adjusting the top of the petals\r\nas I'm gluing them.\r\nNow it's time to add the third layer.\r\nAs you can see, these petals are a little firm,\r\nbut are still very pliable.\r\nFor this layer, also, the petals are more open.\r\nNow it's time to attach the fourth layer.\r\nAnd as I attach it to the center,\r\nyou can see that the flower is starting to take shape.\r\nThis is also when I do my last touches adjusting the petals.\r\nOnce I'm happy with the placement of the petals,\r\nI put it in a former to dry.\r\nOnce a flower has dried, I attach a calyx.\r\nI use the ball tool to thin the edges and to cut the calyx.\r\nThe flower really needs to dry overnight\r\nbefore attaching the calyx.\r\nThe last step we'll do is tape the stem and dust the flower.\r\nFor this rose, I'm using green floral tape.\r\nI really think a little touch of magenta\r\nbring this flower to life.\r\nThat's how you make a simple rose.\r\nNow the cake is ready for me to add the sugar flowers.\r\nFor this cake, I made six types of flowers.\r\nThe first thing I'm going to do is take a ball of fondant,\r\nand attach it to the top of the cake.\r\nThis will act as a base for my flowers.\r\nI'm adding the bigger flowers first,\r\nand then I'll work around it,\r\nfilling in any empty spots with some of the smaller blooms,\r\nlike the cherry blossoms and the freesia.\r\nThose are filler flowers. [peaceful music]\r\nOnce I'm done with the top of the cake,\r\nI use the remaining flowers to fill in the bottom tiers.\r\nYou have to be very careful when inserting into the cake.\r\nIt's not like fresh flowers. They break so easily.\r\n[peaceful music]\r\nWhile I'm attaching the flowers to the cake,\r\nI'm constantly stepping back and looking at my cake\r\nfrom different angles to make sure that it's balanced.\r\nNot only with the different types of flowers,\r\nbut also in terms of color.\r\nIt's like a composition. [peaceful music]\r\nThis is a cake with all the sugar flowers on it.\r\nThe last thing we're going to do\r\nis apply a ribbon to the baseboard.\r\nI think this makes a much nicer presentation.\r\nAnd that's how you assemble\r\nand decorate a five tier wedding cake.\r\n[peaceful music]"

[laughs]\r\nSounds like marbles to me.\r\nIt is, we're gonna trick you with this one, it's marbles.\r\nYou guys are musically gifted.\r\nI dumped mine right out.\r\nOkay, oh, is it a hazelnut?\r\nIt's a hazelnut!\r\nNumber two, hazelnut, nut, Europe.\r\nWait, are we using a garlic press?\r\nYeah you bet ya.\r\nSo it's just to crack 'em,\r\ndon't go mushing, Nina I'm looking at you.\r\nDOn't go mushing it through like it was garlic.\r\n[Nina] Oh I totally would have.\r\nI know, just as a little cracksy doozy.\r\nYeah you nailed it.\r\nWait, where-\r\n[Brad] That actually works really well.\r\nWhat part?\r\nIn the old demo.\r\nJust hold it there,\r\nbut don't go all the way. Just a dab will do ya.\r\nShe's gonna mush it. Oh I really wanna\r\ngo all the way.\r\nJust do it, just push- Can I just see what happens?\r\nJust smash it.\r\nWill it turn into garlic?\r\n[Brad] Only one way to find out Nina!\r\n[laughs] [cracking]\r\nOh! Keep going.\r\nI feel like you gotta take it out of the shell first\r\nif you're gonna go, just let her go.\r\nI don't think we're gonna talk her out of it.\r\nIt might not, oh yeah there we go!\r\nYou gotta taste that though.\r\nYou want me to taste it?\r\nYup Oh!\r\nProbably good- Oh my God\r\nProbably delicious, right?\r\nVery chocolatey.\r\nVery [laughs]\r\nYou're getting that pure hazelnut essence.\r\nYou gotta try this, this is really good.\r\nYou don't have to, a little goes a long way.\r\n[chimes]\r\nIt doesn't taste like chocolate at all,\r\nbut it does remind of of that-\r\nFerrero Rocher.\r\nYes, yes That's what I meant!\r\nWe're all getting it.\r\nI say why don't we try these toasted.\r\nWhen you toast it, it kind of just blooms\r\nand the texture changes a little bit.\r\nI love when you say bloom.\r\n[Brad] Like bringing out flavors or-\r\nYou know what else would make a hazelnut bloom?\r\nYeah.\r\nIf it's paired with a glass\r\nof our fresh vine wine Chardonnay.\r\nFly it right in.\r\nWe'll have that with a little toasted hazelnut.\r\nSounds like a good course to me.\r\nA little Chardonnay, right?\r\nYes, I think with the hazelnuts,\r\nJamey would be really proud of us.\r\nJamey Whetstone is our winemaker.\r\nJamey Whetstone? Oh yeah.\r\nWhat a name! Isn't that a good name?\r\nGod my name sucks.\r\n[laughing]\r\nWell cheers! Cheers to you!\r\nCheers Cheers\r\nNice brightness.\r\nBrings out a little bit of the apple in it.\r\nYou know what I'm tasting?\r\nChocolate Chocolate [laughs]\r\n[rattling]\r\nSounds like marbles.\r\nSounds like music again.\r\nIt's a shake weight.\r\nMacadamia?\r\nYes! Yeah!\r\nIt is a macadamia Looks like a malt ball\r\nMalteser Whopper\r\nIt looks like a really, really small onion.\r\nCome on, onion. Where did you find her?\r\nI don't know [laughing]\r\n[Brad] Number three, macadamia,\r\nseed, Northeast Australia.\r\nOh, hello.\r\nWeapon of choice, can I trust you?\r\nNo Probably not\r\nProbably not.\r\nSo I would make a little nest.\r\nOh a little baby bird nest.\r\nYeah a little holding unit,\r\nand then a little tapsy daisy, oh.\r\nYou guys I didn't realize\r\nthat I've been playing with nuts\r\nthe wrong way this whole time.\r\nNina, Nina this is not, oh no.\r\nThis is terrifying me.\r\n[cracking] Oh god!\r\nBoom!\r\n[laughing] See when I do it my way,\r\nit works!\r\nIt not only looks like it, but it also tastes\r\nlike white chocolate.\r\nIt tastes very vanilla to me.\r\nIt does have a little bit of vanilla to it, right?\r\nThe texture is a little bit gummy.\r\nAnd I think that's from,\r\nwhatever the filler is in there, that grittiness binds.\r\nThis is incredible, can she just\r\nbreak all the nuts from now on?\r\nAnd then also, to keep our culinary adventure alive,\r\nthese are roasted ones.\r\nMore aromatic.\r\nYeah, this is my favorite I think.\r\nI love macadamia. Wait there's something\r\nChristmas-y in this.\r\nIs it a shortbread cookie smell?\r\nOh yeah, I love a shortbread cookie,\r\nand it's probably the fat.\r\nThe texture is so much better too, hey?\r\nMhmm, I love it.\r\nA little more shattery, less mushade.\r\nThis ones mature, feels like it's more complex.\r\nNut bag number four.\r\nOh, I know what this is I got a guess, the shape\r\nI thought it was a Brazil nut, but it's not.\r\nThink more of like a very classic description\r\nof someones beautiful eyes a peanut?\r\nHazelnut? No [laughs]\r\n[Brad] Oh you have such hazelnut-shaped eyes.\r\nAlmond! It's a peanut\r\nI think it's an almond\r\nAn almond? That's my guess,\r\nis an almond.\r\nWhat, these are what almonds look like?\r\nNope, nope not at all.\r\nWhat is this? Not an almond\r\nIt's a Kola, Kola with a K, Kola nut.\r\nNumber four, Kola nut, seed, West Africa.\r\nI see a knife here.\r\nYeah I would do it more, watch it with Nina.\r\nLike a this thing Yeah exactly,\r\nlike a garlic crush.\r\nYeah, cause we love garlic.\r\n[Producer] Nina, may I trust you with this?\r\n[suspenseful violin music]\r\nOh okay look, just a little paper shell\r\ncame off of mine first.\r\nIt's like a dinosaur egg.\r\nAnd then I'm just gonna girdle it with the knife here,\r\nI know it's a weird description.\r\n[Producer] Help Nina with the knife-\r\nNo just let her go, this is great.\r\nYeah you got- yeah you got it,\r\nYou don't have to- We're all learning\r\non this one, we're not going to let you suffer.\r\nYou don't have to smash it,\r\nit's done, now peel it.\r\nIt's done? It was a thin, thin shell\r\nThere you go, see oh, I was waiting-\r\nYeah we all were, it was kind-\r\nI was waiting for that [crack]-\r\nKind of anti-climatic\r\nin the shelling process. Ooh!\r\nI don't even know what to do here.\r\nDo you know what this looks like?\r\nJurassic Park.\r\nIt does look a little bit like\r\nA dinosaur egg do you remember in the-\r\nJurassic Park with Jeff Goldblum, sure do!\r\n[orchestral music]\r\nThat looks like a beautiful walnut,\r\nWell give it a little scratch and sniff.\r\nYeah a little scratch and sniff on that one.\r\nI love walnuts.\r\nAnd then it goes [crackling].\r\nFor the first time I 1000% agree with Nina.\r\nOh see I was thinking [laughing]\r\nI was thinking Alien I feel so seen,\r\nI feel so seen!\r\nIt smells like pine-\r\nIt smells like olive- Like guava-\r\nDo you not smell pine? I don't know\r\nhow to harness it Isn't that pine?\r\n[chuckles] maybe a little.\r\nIt tastes like a tree.\r\nI wanna believe we're not doing it right?\r\nMaybe a little toasting would help.\r\nLet's move on to nut bag number five.\r\nI'm gonna, I think I know what this one is,\r\nI do actually.\r\nI'm gonna say almond, just 'cause you guessed-\r\nEhh, southern Grandma's making a pie.\r\nPecan! Woo!\r\nNumber five, papershell pecan, seed, Southern United States.\r\nI'm just gonna give it little mild, heath compressions.\r\nOh! It pops,\r\nit pops I got it!\r\nThere's one of these if you need it.\r\n[Julianne] Yeah I'm gonna do that.\r\nI might do it for the finesse,\r\nI wanna try and get a whole nut out\r\nand not just a bunch of fragments.\r\nOh there you go, there's our familiar nut.\r\nThat was a good crack,\r\noh no! One of my favorite nuts,\r\nyeah you blew that one, huh?\r\nI did [laughing]\r\nI got a beauty, don't worry guys.\r\nI got more- I gotta start over\r\nAll we needed was one.\r\nSo how do you guys feel about the opening,\r\nthe cracking process of all these nuts?\r\nI really enjoy this.\r\nLook at this one, she'll be here\r\nfor two hours 'til it's perfect.\r\nWith little brushes.\r\nI kind of like it You're gonna break a nail\r\nI don't care It's fine, it's worth it\r\nWhoa I like where you're going with this.\r\nAs long as I get it. Yeah go quick\r\nOh no! No, no, you got this\r\nI just saw it, ahhh.\r\nExcept that one got a little- That's as good as perfect.\r\nSee it's almost in these little halves, right?\r\nYeah but this is pokey-\r\n[laughing] with the soundtrack over here!\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed that.\r\nMy mouth is dry,\r\nit took all of the moisture out of my mouth.\r\nAll I taste is my cheek.\r\nSpeaking of, there's nut all over your face.\r\n[Brad] You got nut all in your hair.\r\nDo I? This one she's a groomer,\r\nI like that about her!\r\nFeel like a monkey.\r\nLet's just get all linear and start\r\npicking nuts out of each others hair.\r\nOh that's the show, thumbnail!\r\nI think, just given the shape,\r\nI know I've said this like five times\r\nand was wrong once, but I think I know what this one is.\r\nI think I know what it is too.\r\nNina's up Is this the nutcracker nut?\r\nWhich is?\r\nI don't know what it's called.\r\nThere's a song about it, it's Christmas-\r\n[singing] Chestnuts-\r\nDon't sing it, they're gonna pull the video.\r\nNumber six, Chestnut, nut, North America, Asia, and Europe.\r\nThe American chestnut used to be\r\nthe predominant tree species in North America,\r\ntill they died from disease.\r\nBut, you can still get 'em, they grow,\r\nand that is the traditional roasted chestnut.\r\nI don't know if I've ever even eaten a chestnut.\r\nOh, 1000% is better roasted.\r\nGuys, do you know what this looks like?\r\nChocolate? Go ahead and tell me\r\nStranger Things.\r\nOh that little thing from that creature,\r\nwhat are they called? Demogorgon.\r\nDemogorgon, that is it!\r\nDemogorgon.\r\nIt's so chestnutty, And warm.\r\nAnd warm, oh look- Smells nice\r\nOh look it even is peeling-\r\nYeah it's pretty awesome.\r\nBut you know what, another common thing\r\nthe flavor of it\r\nthey can turn it into a puree and it's used\r\nin a lot of baking purposes.\r\nChestnut puree- Like a butternut squash soup\r\nMmm no- it kind of tastes\r\nlike that to me It does taste like that\r\nYeah, just like a butternut squash soup.\r\nKind of tastes like bacon Oh my god,\r\ntotally does actually.\r\nLike bacon? It tastes smokey.\r\nMaybe it's just because it was roasted.\r\n[laughs] That open fire\r\nIt pairs really well with the wine too.\r\nBut it also kind of tastes like an apple cider.\r\nYeah all right, I can get that.\r\nMy analogizes are getting weirder and weirder\r\nas the wine is going down further-\r\nSounds like most wine people.\r\nDid you guys have a favorite?\r\nHazelnut and macadamia.\r\nI have to concur.\r\nWell guys thanks again for coming through\r\nand sharing your wine with me, it was delicious.\r\nAnd also learning about nuts together!\r\nThanks for sharing your nuts with us.\r\nThat's what it's all about,\r\nshare your nuts with your friends, drink some wine doing it,\r\nand bon appetit guys! Thank you.\r\nBon appetit! Bon appetit!\r\nIt does have a citrusy piney-\r\nNow I have to peel a whole new one?\r\nDo you know what it took me to get to that point?\r\nThat was 10 years of my life!\r\nIt's enjoyable watching you struggle [laughing]"

      "transcript": "Would Chris Morocco\r\nthink this is a good [chuckles] size tasting spoon?\r\nI don't know.\r\n[utensil clanking] Is that a spoon?\r\n[background laughter] Whoa! [chuckles]\r\nChris just drop this off\r\nand walked away.\r\nWe're gonna taste with this. [laughs]\r\n[groovy music]\r\nHi, my name is Jesse.\r\nI'm the assistant food editor at Bon Appetit.\r\nWe are at the test kitchen today\r\nmaking drunken clam noodles.\r\nIt's a dish that's inspired by a lot of Taiwanese flavors.\r\nIt's made with Taiwanese rice wine,\r\nblack sesame oil,\r\nThai basil,\r\ngarlic and fried ginger.\r\nIs marinades really well with the clams,\r\nit brings down the freshness,\r\nit comes to get a really, really fast,\r\nand it has very intense flavors.\r\nYou can find these combination of flavors\r\non the street of Taiwan.\r\nIt's what I grew up eating a lot.\r\nI find these combination flavors\r\nreally, really soothing and comforting.\r\nIt's called drunken clam noodles\r\nbecause the clams are literally cooked in wine.\r\nSome cooks will even use only the one\r\nand not a drop of water.\r\nWe're using a mix of both.\r\nToday, we're using little neck clams.\r\nSo after I pick up clams from the store,\r\nI like to clean them really well, scrub them,\r\nand after I do that,\r\nI like to store them in salted water,\r\nmimicking the environment that they come from.\r\nSo they keep fresh and alive until you need them.\r\nAlso helps them drawn out some sand in them.\r\nSo you will have no sand in your broth.\r\nWe're gonna cut up our aromatics.\r\nI like to put a bowl down [garlic crackling]\r\nto collect scraps when I'm cooking.\r\nIt just like easier to clean up\r\nand you don't leave a mess after you cook.\r\nWhen I'm peeling a garlic,\r\nI like to use a knife instead of my nails,\r\nI'd like a lot of ginger in my broth.\r\nI'm not peeling it\r\njust because it's just not necessary in this recipe.\r\nPersonally, I don't mind having chunks of ginger\r\nin my noodles,\r\nbut if you do mind that,\r\nand if you do mind the peel,\r\nyou can feel free to peel your ginger.\r\nAnd the next thing we're gonna do is read Thai chili.\r\nYou can adjust the heat as you like;\r\nThree is good for me.\r\nRed Thai chilies are pretty spicy,\r\nof the scale of one to 10,\r\nI'll give it a eight.\r\nSo be careful with them.\r\nAll right, now we're gonna measure out our sauces\r\nand wine and sesame oil or sauce.\r\nOyster sauce, we're gonna use about two tablespoon\r\nand we can adjust it after if it's not salty enough;\r\nit adds a nice umami flavor to your savory dishes.\r\nBlack sesame oil is different\r\nfrom regular toasted sesame oil,\r\nit's made with black sesame seeds,\r\nand it just has a deeper nutty or flavor\r\nthan white sesame seeds.\r\nThis is Taiwanese rice wine.\r\nIt's a staple and Taiwanese kitchen.\r\nI use it in pretty much everything that I cooked;\r\nReally versatile and adds a very nice aromatic\r\nand clean flavor.\r\nAlways removed flammables around your pot\r\nbefore you start cooking,\r\nespecially if you're cooking with any alcohol.\r\nI have my ramen noodles.\r\nThis is a brand that I really like is from Sun Noodle.\r\nIt's very nice, fresh ramen noodle.\r\nIf you don't use fresh ramen noodle,\r\nyou can also use [noodles wrap crackling]\r\ninstant ramen noodles if you like.\r\n[water burbles] We have our boiling water here\r\nready for our noodles.\r\nIt is very important to not salt your water\r\nfor the noodles in this recipe.\r\nThe broth we're making is really flavorful,\r\nso you don't need the extra salt in your noodle water.\r\nAnd I love cooking my noodles in basket like this;\r\nYou don't need to fish for them.\r\nNow, these noodles are ready.\r\nI'm just gonna pull them out,\r\nand I'm gonna just rest them in the serving bowl.\r\nNext, we're gonna build a broth.\r\nWe have a Dutch oven here,\r\nand we're gonna add about one tablespoon\r\nof vegetable oil.\r\nAnd we're gonna fry our ginger\r\nuntil lightly golden brown on both sides.\r\nIt gives this broth a nice fried ginger flavor.\r\nThe ginger is starting to caramelize\r\nand it's smelling like fried ginger in the room now.\r\nSo now we're gonna add in all of our clamps.\r\n[clams clanging]\r\n[clams sizzling]\r\nAnd then our rice wine,\r\nbe careful when you add the wine.\r\nSometimes I forgot I'm pouring wine\r\nand flames comes up.\r\nYou're gonna add our oyster sauce,\r\nour chili and garlic\r\nand our sesame oil.\r\nAnd we're gonna add about a cup and half of noodle water.\r\nI like to keep my noodle water hot,\r\nso it doesn't slow down the cooking process.\r\n[Clams crackling]\r\nWe're gonna cover it up\r\nand let it cook for three to five minutes.\r\nYou know when the clams are done and ready to serve,\r\nwhen they're open;\r\nif they're not open,\r\njust pick them out and don't eat them.\r\nThey might be bad or dead,\r\nand you don't wanna eat them\r\nbecause they might make you sick.\r\nLet's take a look and see if they're ready.\r\nI can see that most of the clams are open.\r\nI think we are in a really good place.\r\nSo now we're just gonna add in our fresh Thai basil,\r\nabout like a handful is good.\r\n[bowl crackling]\r\nWe're not trying to like cut the Thai basil too much;\r\nWe just needed so kind of wilt.\r\nSo the freshness and licorice Thai basil flavors\r\ngoes into the broth a little more.\r\nNow we're stirred in the basil\r\nand we're gonna move back to the island for plating.\r\nWhat I like to do is in a smaller bowl,\r\nkinda push this aside a little bit\r\nso we have more space for our clams.\r\nIt's smelling really good in here;\r\nYou can really smell the clams, the rice wine,\r\nthe fried ginger broth.\r\n[clams crackling]\r\nNow we're gonna ladle our fried ginger broth\r\nall over the noodles and the clams.\r\nAnd I like that it kind of acts like little spoons here.\r\nYou can have a little broth in here,\r\na little garlic, maybe.\r\nThere you go.\r\n[Jesse slurps]\r\nWoo.\r\nIt's very gingery, in a good way.\r\nIt really warms you up instantly.\r\nThere's a little bit of a heat from the red side chili,\r\nand it kinda lingers in your tongue,\r\nwhich is really, really nice.\r\nIt's a classic combination to have white wine with seafood\r\nand the rice wine kinda does the same thing,\r\nbut in a Taiwanese way.\r\nIt's really good; I can drink this all day.\r\n[Jesse sniffing]\r\nIt's a mouthful."

      "transcript": "There are flat people and there\r\nare drumette people. The drumstick.\r\nWhich one are you?\r\nI don't like to pick. I really enjoy both.\r\nI don't feel like I should have to pick one.\r\nI guess if I had to pick, like it's like, Oh, pick!\r\nI think I would pick the flat.\r\n[beep] Yeah, you would 'cause it's the only choice.\r\nIt's so good. It's so good.\r\nToday, we're in the test kitchen\r\ncooking some chicken wings.\r\nI love chicken wings.\r\nYou're gonna go ahead and fry 'em, grill 'em, bake 'em.\r\nThey can take a lot of seasoning on the surface.\r\nDo you wanna go like punchy sour?\r\nDo you wanna go like super spicy?\r\nIt is the ultimate tactile finger food.\r\nIt's a great party food to just serve.\r\n[up-tempo jazzy music]\r\nMm! My God, it's really good.\r\nAbsolutely yes. Oh my God.\r\nI'm about to tear these wings up.\r\n[up-tempo percussive music]\r\nChicken wings are the muscle and the bone structure\r\nin a bird that allow them to fly.\r\nDo chickens actually fly? Oh yeah!\r\nMy chickens sleep in trees 30 feet up\r\nin the cedars like wild turkeys.\r\nBut yeah, today we're gonna be doing a little chicken wing.\r\nAll right, we've got a full wing here.\r\nI like eating them like that.\r\nWe can get away with as a meal more, right?\r\nSo the chicken wings I'm gonna be making\r\nare a baked chicken wing at two different temperatures,\r\n350 and 425, 350 rendering it down, cooking it through,\r\n425 bringing it that nice crispy finishing end.\r\nAnd when we do that right before the crisp,\r\nwe're gonna add some of my favorite spices.\r\nSo we got pink peppercorn,\r\nunderrated in the peppercorn family in my personal opinion.\r\nDo we have any unground ones?\r\nHold please. Flying in the pink berries.\r\nYou really see how it's like a little fruit,\r\nlike a little berry, right?\r\nSo it has this beautiful pink skin on the outside\r\nthat's real oily and real fruity.\r\nThe fragrance alone is amazing.\r\nOh my God, it should be like a candle.\r\nOh my God, I should do that. I should make a candle.\r\nPink peppercorn candle. No one will buy it but me.\r\nAll right, and then the secret weapon\r\nin the world of seedless pepper flakes,\r\nthis is a Turkish maras biber.\r\nThe big takeaway is putting salt on it a day ahead.\r\nIt'll make a hands down better eating experience.\r\nThat salt penetrates through the bone.\r\nWhen salt dissolves, it can go through cell walls.\r\nThank you, Rosemary Trout.\r\nShe's a food scientist. She's wonderful.\r\nI'm gonna go throw these in the fridge, and we'll come back.\r\nWhat's great about those fridge\r\nis that they do pull moisture out of the air.\r\nNice and dry, right? Real dry, perfect for cooking.\r\nSo I think this is just a really nice way to cook chicken.\r\nOh yeah. That's what we're looking for.\r\nLooking real nice. Cooked all the way through.\r\nThis is 45 minutes, and that's what we're looking for.\r\nYou could eat these as is, and they'd be delicious.\r\nWe're gonna zhuzh 'em up a little.\r\nI'll add the pink pepper. Ooh, that looks good already, huh?\r\nAnd we'll add a little black pepper and a little maras.\r\nWe'll do a little bit. Bup bup bup bup.\r\nThere was chicken fat on there,\r\nbut that's just gonna really help\r\nwith the crisping up process, all right?\r\nSo there we have it.\r\nSo I turned it up 425, and at this moment,\r\nyou're not gonna wanna go walking away, all right?\r\nYou're gonna keep an eye on this.\r\nThings are gonna happen quickly.\r\nMight be two minutes. Might be five minutes.\r\nI don't know. Every oven's a little different.\r\nEvery chicken's a little different, all right?\r\nJust keep an eye on it.\r\nI'm looking for that skin to just bring it\r\nto a nice crispy level.\r\nIt was there already, but like just that little extra.\r\nIf I got Morocco deep frying things,\r\nI gotta get my stuff a little more.\r\nOh yeah! Coming out.\r\nNow you don't wanna go too far 'cause then the pepper,\r\nespecially the maras, can start to burn.\r\nLooking good, man.\r\nThe skin rendered out tight to the meat, right?\r\nWe got nice little crispy bubbles going on there.\r\nHot! Look, that's what I'm talking about right there.\r\nYou see how that pepper bled into it a little?\r\nListen, you don't really need a dip with this.\r\nIt's delicious, but if you wanna go that classic route,\r\nlook, I got the blue cheese dressing, all right?\r\nOh God. Pop the joint no problem.\r\nMeat's nice and juicy, seasoned all the way through.\r\nI'm just gonna go ahead and get in there, yeah?\r\n[chicken crunches]\r\nOh yeah. My God, it's really good. [laughs]\r\nI've done this before. These ones are really good.\r\nJust a little.\r\nOh yeah.\r\nSo the meat's perfectly seasoned all the way\r\nthrough the bone,\r\nand that's what that salt does ahead of time.\r\nIt's not real spicy,\r\nbut it's just got a nice roundness of different flavors.\r\nThe pink peppercorn really gives it this fruitiness\r\nas well as the maras.\r\nThe skin rendered out nice.\r\nIt's not like potato chip crunchy,\r\nbut it's rendered to the skin.\r\nIt sucks on real nicely and easy to eat.\r\nAnd at the end of the day, that's what you want, right?\r\nLittle rice, little salad. Call it dinner.\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nToday, I'm making a dry rub Memphis style chicken wing.\r\nWhen I think of a dry wing,\r\nmy mind obviously goes straight to Memphis.\r\nIt's spicy, it's sweet, it's salty, it's savory,\r\nand that's everything I'm looking for in a chicken wing.\r\nFirst things first, we are going to prepare our dry rub,\r\nand this is pretty much the basic dry rub.\r\nThe list of spices may sound endless,\r\nbut you need every spice that's going into here\r\nto really round out the overall spice blend.\r\nSo I'm turning up this dry rub\r\nwith a little bit of pequin chilies, oregano, thyme,\r\ncumin, coriander, and some Worcestershire powder.\r\nWhen you put it in the mortar and pestle,\r\nyou're releasing all of the natural oils,\r\nwhich just activates the spices more.\r\nThis baking powder is going to allow\r\nfor the wings to develop a skin on them\r\nonce we leave 'em in the fridge,\r\nand that skin is going to become really crispy\r\nbecause we are grilling them and we're not frying them,\r\nbut we want crunchy wings.\r\nAnd then once they're coated,\r\nwe are going to transfer them onto a sheet tray\r\nwith a wire, right like this so there's airflow\r\nunder the wing as well.\r\nIt's gonna start to release a little bit\r\nof its natural liquid.\r\nI'm gonna make sure it's dry. Dry wings, dry rub!\r\nSo I'm gonna pop these into the fridge\r\nfor about four to six hours, but best overnight if you can.\r\nWe are going to make an Alabama white sauce.\r\nSo I wanted to keep it in the region of Southern things.\r\nI love Alabama white sauce.\r\nI'm gonna add some mayo,\r\nand we're gonna go ahead and add some apple cider vinegar,\r\nsome salt, some pepper, some Worcestershire,\r\nlemon juice, horseradish, and I'm gonna add in some sugar.\r\nIt's actually perfect.\r\nSo these wings were able to sit over time,\r\nand we can see that they have developed a crust over them,\r\nwhich is gonna crisp up really, really nicely.\r\nSo I'm gonna add some wings.\r\nWe're gonna get that smoky charness on our spices\r\nand on that sugar.\r\nIt's gonna have that caramelized taste to it.\r\nYou wanna make sure you can just flip 'em over easily\r\nbecause if you tend to pull it, the skin will just break.\r\nSo we've developed a nice, crunchy,\r\ndark, brown caramelized crust.\r\nThe spices are looking great.\r\nSo while the wings are still hot,\r\nyou wanna make sure you get that dry rub on there.\r\nSo you're just gonna toss your wings.\r\nYou're gonna make sure you're seasoning this really,\r\nreally heavily and that the wings\r\nare nice and coated all the way.\r\nThey smell amazing.\r\nI'm getting the sweet notes from that sugar.\r\nI'm getting the spicy notes from the pequin.\r\nEach wing has its own amazing little map of spices.\r\nTexturally, I can tell that the baking powder really\r\ntook the chicken skin to the next level.\r\nYou have this really crispy skin.\r\nWe have tender chicken inside.\r\nSo these spices are playing a song right now.\r\nSo good.\r\nEach step that went into making these wings,\r\nI definitely taste.\r\nIt's really, really sweet because of that sugar\r\nthat's in there, but the spice from the pequin chili,\r\nI get the spice on my lips.\r\nI get the spice on my tongue.\r\nI get the spice on my fingers. It's everywhere.\r\nThis sauce complements this dry rub perfectly.\r\nI'm about to tear these wings up.\r\nI don't care. I'm not trying to be cute.\r\nIt's not a cute food, and I'm here for it.\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nTo me, a perfect chicken wing is fried.\r\nThere are other types of wings and they are good,\r\nbut to me, if I'm going to have chicken wings,\r\nI should have fried chicken wings.\r\nTo me, that's the perfect thing.\r\nKaraage is a Japanese frying technique.\r\nIt starts with a marinated base,\r\nand then when you dredge and fry the base,\r\nit's in a mix of flour and potato starch,\r\nand that creates this very light, very crispy outer layer.\r\nSo our first thing is our marinade.\r\nSo we're gonna do equal parts soy sauce and sake.\r\nThe soy is acting as our salt here,\r\nand then we're gonna grate a couple of clothes of garlic,\r\nsome ginger, too.\r\nAnd we're just gonna do a little bit of brown sugar.\r\nJust gonna give that a whisk.\r\nAnd then I am gonna do this in a Ziploc bag.\r\nI just think that's the easiest way.\r\nAnd now we just Shake 'n Bake style,\r\nseal it up, zhuzh that bad boy all around.\r\nOkay, and so we are just gonna leave this in our bowl\r\nin the refrigerator overnight.\r\nDoing it overnight just feels like a nice marker.\r\nI do it the night before, I put it in the fridge,\r\nand then the next night, I'm good to go.\r\nAll right, we back. The chicken is so nicely browned.\r\nYou can see.\r\nAnd we are now going to dredge it\r\nin a mixture of flour and potato starch.\r\nI'm gonna season that with just a little pinch of salt.\r\nWe're just gonna pop them.\r\nYou can see it's just like the lightest little dusting,\r\nlight, little coating on the outside.\r\nPeople will put all sorts of stuff in their dredge,\r\nbut because this is Karaage inspired,\r\nand Karaage is just so simple and clean,\r\nthe highlight is this marinade\r\nthat imbues the chicken with all that flavor\r\nand then this crispy outer bite.\r\nLook how cute these look.\r\nThey look so nice, and you can just, ugh,\r\nthey wanna be fried.\r\nThey're ready to be fried.\r\nWhat's nice about these is there's just enough meat\r\non these chicken wings that it's not gonna take forever\r\nto cook and it's mostly a visual cue thing\r\nwhere you can be watching how dark the outside gets.\r\nIt's just like a little paler than you\r\nmight imagine fried chicken to be.\r\nThis is like the telltale sign of Karaage\r\nis the starchy, crispy little granules.\r\nThat's the potato chip crisp. That's the golden ticket.\r\nThat's what you're looking for.\r\nSo you do wanna season pretty quickly\r\nafter they come out of the fryer\r\nbecause that is how the seasoning is gonna stick.\r\nOh my God.\r\nYou can see all the little starchy, crispy bits throughout.\r\nSo we are just going to plate these up with our friends,\r\nand then you gotta have lemon wedges\r\non the side for Karaage.\r\nThese are my Karaage-style chicken wings.\r\nOh yeah. Hell yeah.\r\nOh my God. Look at how crispy.\r\nMm mm mm mm. Oh my God, that marinade is so flavorful.\r\nYou taste that soy and sake and ginger and garlic so much.\r\nOh my God, and it's not crunchy.\r\nThat's the number one thing. This is crispy.\r\nIt's like this light melt-in-your-mouth crispiness.\r\nThank you for asking me to make chicken wings. [laughs]\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nI love a crispy skin.\r\nI feel like I don't really love a wing that's too saucy.\r\nSo today, I'm making my version of a chicken wing.\r\nIt's a sticky tamarind wing with a scotch bonnet aioli.\r\nChoosing this method because I love a crispy texture.\r\nI love the fact that you have sweetness\r\nand sourness from the tamarind and also a little bit\r\nof spice on the side from the aioli itself.\r\nWe're gonna dry brine the wings first.\r\nI'm just gonna take like a tablespoon of salt,\r\nand I'm going to take the zest of one whole lemon.\r\nWhen you have these really beautiful long strands\r\nof lemon zest, you get that charred lemony flavor into it.\r\nThe first step of this is just really trying\r\nto maximize the dryness and the dryer the better\r\nwhen it comes chicken skins.\r\nAnd so operation chicken wing first step is complete.\r\nThese chicken wings have been sitting\r\nin the fridge for 16 hours.\r\nYou can see the meat under the flesh.\r\nYou can also feel it, too.\r\nThere's actually no moisture on my fingers.\r\nThe moisture has been pulled out, one, because of salt,\r\ntwo, because of that dry fridge environment.\r\nGoes in the oven 375 degrees.\r\nSo what I do is I'll let the texture develop first,\r\nlet those salts that are already in there develop,\r\nand then I'll glaze it towards the end\r\nof the cooking process.\r\nSo let's talk about the glaze.\r\nTamarind is the base of my glaze.\r\nTamarind is a really incredible plant, and essentially,\r\nthere is pulp inside surrounding the tamarind seed.\r\nSo it's sour and has a sweetness to it.\r\nI'm gonna start by just taking two clothes of garlic,\r\nwhole allspice berries.\r\nI'll throw the bay leaf into the pestle as well.\r\nAnd really,\r\nit's not about actually getting them really fine.\r\nIt's just about like waking up and macerating those flavors.\r\nI'll just go ahead and add my tamarind,\r\nmy sherry vinegar, a bit of honey, coconut aminos,\r\nginger powder, salts, and then sugar.\r\nIt's gonna be sweet, but then it's not,\r\nand then it quickly, it won't.\r\nThen she'll turn on you. She'll be like, Ugh!\r\nI thought you were sweet. What happened?\r\nWe are heating it up.\r\nWater is gonna evaporate out of it,\r\nand we're going to be left with something\r\nthat feels more like a loose syrup.\r\nIt's like between syrup and jam, and while that's happening,\r\nI'm just gonna make a quick aioli.\r\nSo aioli, basically, it's egg yolk,\r\nand then we have oil to emulsify it.\r\nI like to use coconut oil,\r\nand this just complements that resiny coconut sap flavor\r\nfrom the coconut aminos.\r\nI have my scotch bonnet, just so that we have the heat.\r\nSo we have garlic, a little bit of allspice.\r\nGonna add like a tablespoon of salt or so.\r\nI'm gonna add my lemon juice.\r\n[blender whirs]\r\nTake our coconut and just slowly add it, too.\r\nJust like a coconut shower. So I'm just gonna turn this off.\r\nSo then we have our aioli that is made.\r\nWhat I'm gonna do is go over to the glaze.\r\nThe glaze is looking really good.\r\nYou're going to just strain this,\r\nand this is what your finished product should look like.\r\nOur wings smell credible.\r\nSo what I'll do is just very quickly take my glaze.\r\nWe wanna develop flavor and texture as we go.\r\nSo we've rotated, we've basted,\r\nand then we're gonna transfer these to a broiler set to 500.\r\nOur wings are done. They smell incredible.\r\nOne of my favorite things about this\r\nis just the color that develops on the wing,\r\nthat we have a dark deep brown bubbly moment\r\nthat's happening on the skin.\r\n[chicken crunches]\r\nOh my God. Absolutely yes.\r\nIt has that sweet and sourness.\r\nI think it's perfectly balanced\r\nwith the honey and the sugar and the coconut,\r\nand the brightness from the tamarind\r\nand the sherry vinegar really comes through in a way.\r\nIt's sticky. It's crunchy.\r\nI'm just gonna spoon a little bit of this\r\non it just to see what it's giving.\r\nOh my God. Woo!\r\nIt's not just spicy. It's also that fruity spicy moment.\r\nIt's cool because if you're into frying\r\nbut you wanna switch it up, baking is a really great option.\r\nAdd it to your wing library.\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nThe wing is where you get all of the nuances\r\nof texture and fattiness and richness\r\nand flavor of an entire chicken but distilled down\r\nto its own microcosmic universe.\r\nI wanna see the ultimate in that duality\r\nof crispy and textural but also tender.\r\nI'm making fried chicken wings.\r\nSo the first thing is we're gonna make a spice mix.\r\nI wanna go somewhat heavy on salt here,\r\nand then putting in some paprika, cayenne,\r\nonion powder, and garlic powder.\r\nYou could skip this pre-seasoning step\r\nand go right to a brine, but the more you do, I think,\r\nthe more benefits you're gonna reap on the back end.\r\nI'm doing buttermilk here, pepper, hot sauce.\r\nLove Crystal. Then I'm just gonna drop the wings in.\r\nIf you use a bag, you can use less liquid\r\nand still have everything be nicely coated.\r\nThe acidity in the buttermilk is what\r\nis going to tenderize the meat by acting\r\non the proteins in the meat.\r\nThat will go into the fridge for about 12 hours or so,\r\nand we will see it later.\r\nSo wings have been brining for 12 hours.\r\nI wanna make the dredge.\r\nSo I've got all purpose flour here, some rice flour,\r\nto which give that pretty wildly intensely crunchy texture.\r\nI've got the remaining spice rub because I think you want\r\nto get some flavor in there as well.\r\nNot unreasonable to frankly just take a little pinch\r\nand taste it.\r\nYou wanna just make sure you definitely get the flavors\r\ngoing on in there.\r\nMm!\r\nWell, a little more black pepper,\r\nbut it's really nicely seasoned.\r\nAdding a little bit of the liquid from the brine\r\ninto the dredge, the liquid is going to be one of the things\r\nthat allows that dredge to really cling in force.\r\nYeah, you're putting some raw chicken juices in this dredge,\r\nbut anything that it touches is gonna get fully cooked out.\r\nIt's nice to really pack the dredge on.\r\nThis should hopefully give us the crags, the nooks,\r\nthe crannies, and the whorls that we're looking for.\r\nWe're ready to fry it.\r\nI'm not gonna try to crowd the skillet.\r\nI'm gonna do four pieces here.\r\nIt is certainly bubbling vigorously.\r\nFor keeping the oil a little bit on the lower side,\r\nlike a 325 as opposed to a 375,\r\ndrawing the cooking process out means you keep the browning\r\nin check such that you can let the inside cook\r\nthrough where you want to be over time.\r\nI'm getting a lot of great color all\r\nalong the bottom and the sides here.\r\nI just wanna carefully turn these over.\r\nI don't want them to get too much more color than that,\r\ncertainly on like that side.\r\nIt's more just a question of wanting to optimize\r\nfor that crunchy exterior,\r\nmaking sure the inside is cooked all the way through.\r\nThere's just something about that final drizzle of honey,\r\na little bit of hot sauce.\r\nIt brings in just an extra dynamic set of flavors.\r\nTotal deep crag, literally just flaky, crunchy.\r\nSo bright, so happy. I think this is a pretty great outcome.\r\n[chicken crunches]\r\nIt's so crunchy, it's flaky, but let's see how we did.\r\n[chicken crunches]\r\nMm. It's really good.\r\nThere's a lot of texture happening here,\r\nand it's really nice to have that hot sauce\r\nwith that vinegar and a little bit\r\nof that chili heat to brighten things up.\r\nJust such a great case study for how chicken wings\r\ncan really absorb all the flavor,\r\nall of the textures you care to throw at them.\r\nI'm very impressed. It's beautiful.\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nYeah, I'm making confit chicken wings.\r\nThe reason why I'm making confit chicken wings\r\nis because Chris Morocco is doing fried, and they said,\r\nHarold, you're the youngest one, so you gotta do confit.\r\nThis method is the best way that you can do chicken wings\r\nif you're making a big batch.\r\nWe're gonna cook this for about an hour at 300 degrees.\r\nSuper low and slow.\r\nWe would use schmaltz or chicken fat for these guys,\r\nbut we're gonna be using duck fat,\r\nwhich is in the same family, right?\r\nIt's in the same poultry family.\r\nWe're just gonna go ahead and go heavy on the seasoning,\r\nand so when we confit it,\r\nthere's not a lot of liquids coming out of the chicken.\r\nAnd then we're gonna let this sit in this salt\r\nand pepper mix for about five hours.\r\nHey, it's Chris Morocco!\r\n[Chris] I'm gonna put coffee\r\nin your drawer. Yes, sir. Thanks, man.\r\nI expect it to be there tomorrow.\r\nYes, sir. [laughs] Everybody sees the coffee\r\ngoing in the drawer?\r\nThere's no drawer in there. It's now on the floor.\r\nSo good talk, everyone.\r\nI guess we're gonna put it in the middle drawer.\r\nHere's our chicken wings.\r\nYou can tell all the moisture is coming\r\nout of the chicken already, right?\r\nWhat we're gonna do next is go ahead\r\nand lay down our chicken in the bottom of this hotel pan.\r\nSimple aromatics I'm throwing in there,\r\na little bit of thyme, a couple of pieces of garlic,\r\nand then I like to put a little Thai chili, just one.\r\nSo I'm using duck fat, and then I go ahead and top it off\r\nwith a neutral oil, which is grape seed oil,\r\nwhich doesn't have that much flavor to it,\r\nbut it's great for cooking.\r\nIf you have duck fat, you can just use duck fat all the way,\r\nbut duck fat is pretty expensive.\r\nYou gotta submerge it in the fat.\r\nI'm gonna go ahead and just put foil on top,\r\nand the oven should be at 300.\r\nWhat's gonna happen is it's gonna cook slowly.\r\nIt's gonna cook it all the way through.\r\nNow I'm gonna make my dipping sauce with my banana ketchup.\r\nNow banana ketchup is my blue cheese dressing.\r\nYou know what I mean?\r\nBanana ketchup is a condiment\r\nthat's pretty much super popular in the Philippines.\r\nThis is gonna be like the base of the sauce itself.\r\nI use fish sauce and then oyster sauce.\r\nAll right, that's great. I like that.\r\nI think the dipping sauces are very important to wings.\r\nLet's go check on our chicken wings.\r\nBeen cooking at 300 degrees for about an hour.\r\nSo the chicken itself tightened up a little bit.\r\nIt's basically cooked now.\r\nSo I was gonna brush a little bit more of this oil on top,\r\nbut then I'm gonna go ahead and glaze this chicken\r\nand give it another level of flavor.\r\nI wanna see what the Maillard reaction looks like.\r\nThere's sugar in this mix\r\nin the banana ketchup and oyster sauce.\r\nSmells amazing, really. All right, cool.\r\nI'm gonna throw it in. Let's check it out.\r\nWow, smells good!\r\nYou see a lot of these nice little blisters on 'em.\r\nI'm just gonna break down the wings for plating.\r\nOof! Let's do a three wing situation.\r\nWe gotta do scallions.\r\nWe gonna do a little bit pickled jalapeno,\r\nsome Thai chilies.\r\nI'm gonna put a little bit more of that sauce\r\non the side, then boom.\r\nSo these are my confit wings.\r\nMm-hmm. That's nice.\r\nSuper juicy still.\r\nThe dipping sauce itself right now\r\nis giving it these levels to the chicken.\r\nIt's super tender, it's juicy,\r\nand it only took us like six minutes to broil it,\r\ngive it the char, and it's already cooked.\r\nYou know what I mean? It's great.\r\n[soft up-tempo percussive music]\r\nToday, the wings I'm gonna make is gonna be braised,\r\nwhich is a technique that's very common in Taiwan.\r\nThey usually have a whole spread of ingredients\r\nfor you to choose from, and they'll braise\r\nand chop and their special house liquid for you.\r\nSo I would just have a bag of wings\r\nwith a light beer in my hand. [laughs]\r\nThe braise are we gonna be making today\r\nis gonna make with some five spice, some ginger,\r\nand it's gonna be finished with a glaze made with Coca-Cola.\r\nWe're gonna add our ginger and garlic here.\r\nWe want all of the garlic and ginger flavors go\r\ninto the liquid so it\r\ncan make the chicken wings very, very flavorful.\r\nOnce we have these garlic and ginger picking up some color,\r\nwe can add in our chicken wings.\r\nWe're gonna lightly fry these chicken wings just\r\nfor them to have a lightly seared skin.\r\nNow I'm going to also add some dry chilies\r\nand some scallions.\r\nThe frying of the skin\r\nis gonna add a little more browning flavor\r\ninto our cooking liquid.\r\nElevates it a little bit\r\nversus putting just raw chicken wings into the braise.\r\nHere I have some oyster sauce.\r\nThen this is five spice powder, some white pepper,\r\nand then I have dark soy sauce,\r\nand I'm gonna add in water with this,\r\nand now we're just gonna have them cover\r\nand braise them for about 20 minutes.\r\nOoh! I can see it's picking up some really nice color.\r\nThat means it's also picking up very nice flavor\r\ninto it as well.\r\nNow we're gonna move on to the glazing part.\r\nI'm gonna start with a fresh new pot here.\r\nJust make sure you save the liquid because you\r\ncan reuse it to braise a lot of different things.\r\nWe're gonna add in our water,\r\nsome raw sugar, a touch of salt,\r\nand we're gonna wait for it to come to a boil.\r\nAnd now I think it's ready for our wings to go in,\r\nand that is a good timing to add the rest of our ingredient.\r\nWe have our Mexican Coke here.\r\nIt's gonna add some sweetness and also a nice color to it,\r\nand this is our Taiwanese rice wine.\r\nFinally, we have white vinegar to add some nice tang to it.\r\nNow we cover it and let it cook\r\nwhile it's boiling for about 15 minutes.\r\nIt's looking pretty good.\r\nWe're gonna have it reduce,\r\nand what we're looking for is\r\nto have all the liquids almost all cooked off\r\nand become very sticky.\r\nNow it is getting super condensed and glazy.\r\nYou can see I'm gonna push it like that.\r\nIt's leaving some space.\r\nEven from the tongs, they feel very, very tender,\r\nalmost falling apart.\r\nThen we're just gonna top them\r\nwith some toasted sesame seeds just\r\nto garnish them and to have a little bit\r\nof the nutty flavor and some scallions\r\nto add some freshness and some nice bright color.\r\nAnd those are my wings.\r\nThe bone's already falling off just by touching them.\r\nIt's super tender, super flavorful.\r\nThe braised liquid really get the savoriness into the bone,\r\nand the glaze outside of the skin just\r\ngives it a right amount of sweetness\r\nthat complement the savoriness.\r\nFor me, what's special about this recipe\r\nis that the flavor is on the skin.\r\nIt's on the meat. It's in the bones.\r\nIt's just has all the flavor in and out,\r\nand that's what makes good wings to me.\r\nI remember one time I was at a party\r\nand there was a bunch of wings that were ordered,\r\nand I had a bunch of homegirls there.\r\nWe were all dressed up, looking cute,\r\nand like I'm in the back just like tearing these wings up.\r\nAnd my homegirl are like, Girl, chill out.\r\nI'm like, I don't give a [beep].\r\nI'm about to tear these wings up."

Tender, sweet, briny ocean-ness.\r\nI'd say they're done. I'm gonna pull them.\r\nSuch a slob.\r\nLet's let this cool for a second, okay, and in the meantime\r\nI'm gonna put my olive oil solution together.\r\nI have a nice little leek here, little cute baby leek,\r\nlittle shallot, I'm gonna slice those up.\r\nI like them nice and thin.\r\nThey sweat out quick.\r\nI mean the shallot, I think it's a little sweeter,\r\nit has a little bit more of a delicacy.\r\nA bit traditional as well, maybe.\r\nAnd I'm just gonna bloom those,\r\nsweat them out for a few minutes,\r\nand then I'm gonna add in the garlic, the aromatics,\r\nsome really cool pepper that I got from Turkey.\r\nI might even throw in a little dried, cured salami.\r\nI think that'd be nice.\r\nJust like four slices.\r\nAnd I'm gonna just kind of put it into little strips.\r\nSo yeah, we got our olive oil,\r\nthen we're gonna add our veg,\r\nand then I'm just gonna hit it with a little heat, you know.\r\nNothing crazy, just take the rawness off it\r\nand keep it nice.\r\nSo let that go.\r\nI'm gonna slice up the garlic while that heats.\r\nWe might go three with this one.\r\nAnd then one we'll just crush as a soaker,\r\nthat thing can just hang in there.\r\nAnd then look, we've got some fresh bay leaves,\r\nlittle bit of thyme, little rosemary.\r\nWe'll bloom this at the end.\r\nLet me start picking some mussels.\r\nIt's gonna take like a while.\r\nI just sit here, talking to myself.\r\nBut look it, ah beautiful.\r\nI mean, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\r\nSo mussels, look, so when they pop open,\r\nit's attached to an inductor there, little muscle,\r\nand you just kind of pop that off.\r\nThis one didn't open, and that's it.\r\nI'm not gonna go forcing it.\r\nYou're gonna lose a couple, you know.\r\nMaybe it's fine, maybe it's like the, ugh.\r\nEvery now and then, I'm not gonna lie,\r\nif one just looks like really weird,\r\nI just throw it right back, just get rid of it.\r\nThis is it, you know. Putting time in.\r\nThis is good, you got some friends,\r\nhave like a little mussel party.\r\n[funky music]\r\nAll right, we're good.\r\nAnd then look, we got our little bloom yum there,\r\na little olive oil with the shallots and leek.\r\nAnd then look, we're gonna add the garlic in there,\r\nsoup-y sausage, our aromatics, secret weapon too,\r\nwe're gonna add a pinch of saffron.\r\nSaffron is, if you're not familiar,\r\nit's the little [pop noise]\r\nwhat do they call it, like a pistola, of a flower, right?\r\nThe little [whistling] little pollen, yes stamen, maybe!\r\nYeah, maybe that's what it is!\r\nYeah, and that has a very unique, strong,\r\naromatic kind of flavor.\r\nAnd I think it would be delightful\r\nwith these little components that we have.\r\nI'm just gonna bring it up to heat for a minute,\r\njust let that kind of bloom up.\r\nAnd then for our spices, are similar to paprika,\r\nI'm gonna open that baby up.\r\nOoh, yeah, that smells nice.\r\nLook at the color on that, this is gonna be great.\r\nWe're going two teaspoons, little bit of pink peppercorn,\r\nI'm gonna add a pinch of salt too.\r\nAnd then as far as vinegar goes,\r\nyou can use whatever vinegar you want.\r\nI prefer something kind of bright.\r\nChampagne works great.\r\nI'm gonna add that right to the oil mixture.\r\nHeavy quarter cup.\r\nSo look, now we're nice and hot.\r\nOff the heat, onto the meat.\r\n[laughing, joke effect drums]\r\nWe're gonna pour the oil over the mussels\r\nand then I'm gonna spoon in the solids.\r\nOh, look at that, huh?\r\nI like the residual heat from that oil there\r\nto kind of bring the party up to temperature\r\nwith the nice little melding of flavors\r\nwith the mussels, all that mussel juice,\r\nall that mussel broth, and all those mussel flavors\r\nand the paprika and the sausage,\r\nbut that's it.\r\nI usually let it chill on the counter for 20 minutes\r\nwith the lid cracked or off\r\nand then I keep it in the fridge\r\nand you can either re-heat it,\r\neat it hot with whatever, or you can eat it,\r\nwe're just gonna eat it in like 15 minutes.\r\nI'm gonna clean this mess up,\r\nand then we're gonna have it with some crackers,\r\nand sounds like a little tasty snack.\r\nTake five, dude.\r\nMake yourself a cup of Earl Gray tea\r\nwith a little bit of cream and some honey,\r\nand we'll catch up in a few minutes.\r\n[waiting music]\r\nIs it chilly out?\r\nOoh, I'm putting a layer on.\r\nI'll go back in the see-ers.\r\nYou cannot use this footage, I'll sue-\r\n[waiting music]\r\nAll right, let's give it a shot, huh? Now it's an oily guy\r\nand I always ruin my clothes with oil.\r\nI like this sweatshirt, I like these pants.\r\nI'm gonna eat it like, you know, a gyro.\r\n[romantic piano music]\r\nMm, that's fantastic.\r\nYou know it's got the leeks in there,\r\nlot of big flavors,\r\nlot of big flavors like paprika and something like paprika,\r\nlot of garlic, the brightness in the vinegar.\r\nI'm gonna make another one, that was delicious.\r\nAgain, I think the biggest takeaway\r\nis just to not overcook them, like look at that.\r\nLook at this fricking' beauty.\r\nLittle pink peppercorn, little bit of leek.\r\n[bleep]\r\nMm, these are really good.\r\nLike make Chris Morocco proud kind of good.\r\nYou ever had someone comb your eyebrows before?\r\nNo.\r\nOh buddy, you ain't lived yet.\r\nIs that true?\r\nOh it's good stuff.\r\nTold me he loved me once.\r\nPickled mussels, easy to do, delicious.\r\nBring it to a party, bring it to uh...\r\nBring it wherever you want,\r\nbring it out the middle of a cedar orchard.\r\nPut that with a little spaghetti\r\nor some rice noodles or something,\r\nyou know, throw some squid in there too.\r\nMaybe a little clam.\r\nYou know, it's just fun for the whole family.\r\nCheck it out. Bon Appétit!\r\nThat's the outro, just the howling of the wind.\r\nOh and the truck."

      "transcript": "If you wanna break a couple of them apart,\r\nlike that's fine.\r\nI prefer to just like,\r\nleave the leaves a little bit more whole\r\nand then eat my salads\r\nwith like a knife and fork.\r\nBut then again, I eat pizza with a knife and fork.\r\nSo it's not really saying much\r\n[Rusty] Do you eat a burger with your hands?\r\n[laughs] I draw the line on burgers.\r\n[bright music]\r\nThis recipe for this salad came out of a desire\r\nto kind of showcase like how I like making salads in winter.\r\nCold weather and winter is about like anything but lettuce.\r\nAnd there's so many other things\r\nthat make for great salads\r\nduring that cold weather season.\r\nRadicchio is kind of top of the list for me.\r\nIt's in the Chicory Family.\r\nThey are this wonderful family of very assertively flavored,\r\nleafy veg, anything.\r\nI think, you know that lettuce can do,\r\nRadicchio can do better.\r\n[bright music]\r\nI have to say hazelnut is my favorite nut.\r\nI'll like [beep] die for hazelnut.\r\nAlmonds are good too.\r\nI celebrate the walnut, pistachio,\r\nI mean, sure nothing to sniff up,\r\nbut I'm sorry, like cashews they're...\r\nI just don't think they're that good.\r\nLike they're not.\r\nDoes anybody like wanna die for a cashew?\r\n[Rusty] No.\r\nAll right, so these are going in the oven\r\nand we're gonna forget about it, okay?\r\nIt's gonna be about seven to 10 minutes,\r\nsomething in that range for 350 degrees.\r\nWhen you apply heat to it, you are changing the fats,\r\nyou are developing flavors,\r\nyou know you are unlocking aromatic compounds.\r\nThere's just so many different things\r\nthat go into those processes.\r\nAnd so much flavor becomes accessible when you do that.\r\nThis is at about eight or nine minutes.\r\nThose look great.\r\nI mean, it's just like a whole order of magnitude darker,\r\nbut I think we're still on the right side of the line.\r\nYou know, I think like five more minutes\r\nand they'd be a little bit too much kind of like,\r\nyou know kind of accurate bitterness,\r\nbut this looks great to me.\r\n[Rusty] Why'd you put those in the oven?\r\nWhy don't you cook them in skillet?\r\nOh yeah, this guy.\r\nLet's do a demo.\r\nIf you're toasting nuts in a skillet,\r\nall of the heat is coming from the bottom\r\nof that pan pretty much, right?\r\nSo your contact area is actually very, very, very small.\r\nSo what that means is you have nuts\r\nthat are very unevenly toasted.\r\nYou will never, I repeat,\r\nnever get nuts like this, okay?\r\nIf you toast them dry in a skillet.\r\nDoing them in the oven low and slow,\r\nit really just roasts them throughout.\r\n[bright music]\r\nHow do you turn salad into dinner more or less?\r\nYou need a little bit of protein,\r\nyou need a little bit of like, you know,\r\nkind of texture and a couple of things going on\r\nfor it to really feel like a meal.\r\nI find that the black quinoa\r\nhas like the most texture to it.\r\nAnd the most kind of pronounced nutty kind of grassy flavor.\r\nI'm gonna grab, you know, pot of water.\r\nAnd then we're going to cook this quinoa like pasta.\r\nWhen I say cook it like pasta,\r\nI mean an excess of water,\r\nonce it's boiling, the grain is gonna go in.\r\nIt's going to simmer until it's al dente, or tender.\r\nAnd then all the water is gonna be drained out,\r\nand I'm gonna return it to the pot\r\njust to kind of let it steam out\r\na little bit of the excess liquid at that point.\r\nI want fluffy distinct grains\r\nthat are gonna separate, that are going to disperse\r\nthroughout whatever I'm throwing them into.\r\nGood amount of salt,\r\nand then quinoa's gonna go right in.\r\nWe can leave it uncovered just so you're looking at it,\r\nmaking eye contact with it,\r\nnot forgetting about it and just walking away.\r\nSo let's see what's happening\r\nwith this here quinoa, all right?\r\nThis is looking good.\r\nHere's what we're gonna do.\r\nWe're gonna drain it.\r\nI wanna take out as much of this water as possible.\r\nYou're gonna get these, like, you know,\r\nthese loose, you know, kind of germs\r\nkind of coming off of the quinoa.\r\nAnd that's what you're looking for.\r\nSo now, off heat.\r\nI'm gonna cover it a little bit.\r\nExtra moisture is gonna steam out of that quinoa.\r\nAnd I'm just gonna kinda pour it off\r\nwhen I go to use it in a few minutes, all right?\r\n[bright music]\r\nSpicy things and sweet things,\r\nyou know very often can go together,\r\nespecially in savory culinary applications.\r\nI'm gonna do a couple of tablespoons of honey.\r\nI'm just gonna thin this out with a little bit of water.\r\nI just don't want it to start to burn.\r\nSo we've got gochugaru and Aleppo\r\nas our mild crushed red pepper flakes here.\r\nGochugaru, you know Korean chili flakes,\r\njust a wonderful addition to your pantry\r\nbecause they're relatively mild.\r\nThey have an almost inherent sweetness to them.\r\nSo I'm just gonna bring this\r\nto a really quick simmer over on the stove.\r\nAnd that's just gonna bloom the flavor of the chili.\r\nAll right, so we just brought it to a quick summer,\r\nquick little infusion.\r\nIt also just dissolves the honey a little bit\r\nso that it's gonna disperse nicely through our dressing.\r\nSo I'm gonna throw in our olive oil, and then rice vinegar.\r\nThere's a lot of flavors going on in there.\r\nBut until you put a pretty decent amount of salt in there,\r\nit's not really even gonna taste like much.\r\nWith the salt in there,\r\neverything's just like turned up.\r\nAnd it's like one in a catch in the back of my throat,\r\njust a little bit more.\r\nIt's really nice.\r\n[bright music]\r\nBeing able to build a salad in a bowl,\r\nand be able to kind of manipulate it a little bit,\r\ndoes wonders.\r\nYou want to, you know, get each leaf coated\r\nwith the right amount of dressing.\r\nYou wanna season by dispersing,\r\nyou know, salt, whatever else,\r\nyou know, across like as much of the surface area\r\nas you can.\r\nThe way these sort of petals,\r\nthe way these leaves are arranged\r\nis sort of in these like concentric rings, right?\r\nSo if you kind of just like find the edge,\r\nand sort of pull the leaf apart,\r\nyou can just sort of like work your way around,\r\nand not necessarily tear them all.\r\nWhen it comes to radicchio, one type is great,\r\ntwo types is better,\r\nthree types I feel like makes you an all star\r\nand so fun.\r\nI'm just breaking up some of these Treviso.\r\nI'm gonna throw some of this quinoa in here,\r\nI'm gonna put in some dressing.\r\nNow, this dressing has been seasoned up just with salt.\r\nYou know, I'm gonna bump up\r\nlike a little extra salt in here.\r\nYou need to be tasting as you go, always,\r\nyou know, see is the amount of dressing enough?\r\nYou know, don't use it all right away.\r\nUse about half, see where you're at.\r\nThe salt is there.\r\nAll right, ready to take this to the platter.\r\nSometimes I like just honestly use my hands\r\nfor this stage after I'm done.\r\nBut I just find like\r\nall those different shades of radicchio,\r\nall the color, all the textures,\r\nall the different flavors just so fun.\r\nLike a little like extra scatter quinoa,\r\nso make sure you've got enough in there.\r\nA little final drizzle of dressing,\r\nyou know, hazelnuts like you can chop them.\r\nYou know, when they're this toasty and crunchy,\r\nyou can just kind of crush them with the flat of your hand.\r\nYou know, you can't do that with an under toasted nut\r\nor God helped me a cashew, especially a raw one.\r\nThis is Cotija.\r\nIt's just a really lovely salty kind of funky cheese\r\nfrom Mexico.\r\nAnd some cilantro, there we go.\r\nFirst, I wanna like taste a piece of Castelfranco.\r\nThere's like this warmth to it\r\nthat's amplified by the hot honey vinaigrette.\r\nLike if you're hesitant, you know, hearing that title\r\nand thinking that it's going to be like overly spicy,\r\nit's really not.\r\nAnd I got a lot of flak at home for creating salads\r\nthat are frankly nothing but radicchio,\r\nbut that is truly what I crave.\r\nYou know, it's easy to have on hand,\r\nit stays just perfectly well for weeks at a time\r\nin your crisper drawer, it's ready when you need it.\r\nAnd then it just provides all the texture\r\nyou could ever want, really interesting flavor.\r\nAnd it wants to soak up other flavors as well,\r\nand really balance them out.\r\nEverything in there honestly like,\r\nthere's a lot of flavor and there's a lot of texture\r\nhappening with every single element.\r\nBut put them all together, it's just delicious.\r\n[bright upbeat music]\r\n[Rusty] All right.\r\nNow, I just wanna redo the recipe\r\nwith an apron that doesn't have a stain on it.\r\n[all laughing]"

      "transcript": "[hood dings]\r\nHey guys, today on It's Alive,\r\nwe're gonna be doing a real, simple, fun fermented recipe.\r\nFermented chili, hot honey.\r\nAnd then we're going to drizzle it over,\r\nand make a little fried chicken.\r\nHell of a snack, hell of a treat, hell of a dinner.\r\n[rock music]\r\nOh. Whew. Ha!\r\nWe're here at my house.\r\nWe're going to start with the chilies, alright.\r\nSo the recipe calls for five habaneros, one serrano,\r\nand then one jalapeno.\r\nI got some red jalapenos.\r\nSo I'm going to scale that up a little bit.\r\nI'm going to go two of each of the others,\r\nand six habaneros.\r\n[pans clink]\r\nI really love the floral-ness,\r\nthat's kind of this real tropical notes,\r\nas well as a lot of heat that comes from the habaneros.\r\nI throw the seeds right in there, too.\r\nAnd then with the peppers,\r\nI just like to slice them thin,\r\nthat way they really just kinda\r\ninfuse really nicely and ferment in that honey.\r\nWe're gonna throw it over some fried chicken today.\r\nAnd then right in, right in the jar.\r\nKind of originated from the garlic, fermented garlic, honey.\r\nIt almost looks like it's not even honey.\r\nAnd we didn't add anything else.\r\nVery similar application.\r\nThis one's just a bit spicier.\r\nI mean, any other flavor notes you could really,\r\nyou could throw a cinnamon stick in there,\r\nif you wanted to, throw a couple,\r\na couple of threads of saffron, if you're feeling,\r\nif you're feeling cute, knock yourself out, you know?\r\nOh, with the honey, you just wanna get\r\nthe best stuff you can.\r\nI like to get a nice local, raw honey.\r\nA lot of people out there, there's all types.\r\nThere's a big honey community,\r\nif you look, you know, they got different hives,\r\nyou can get, go to farmer's markets.\r\nIt's definitely the way to go.\r\nBees, oh, the bees, the great pollinators.\r\nAnd then look, I'll cut up a little\r\na couple of cloves of garlic.\r\nCrush in the garlic and it gets\r\nthat nice allicin going, but then also slicing it.\r\nYou know, that, that does it as well.\r\nAnd I just like how it can,\r\nyou can have nice little thin slices.\r\nyou can kind of spoon over food,\r\nusing it more as a condiment.\r\nAnd then, again, some honey,\r\nlike I said, you just want to get some,\r\nI'm up here in Connecticut and we've\r\ngot some nice Connecticut honey from,\r\nOh, Cory's family.\r\nThey got some hives and they set us up with\r\nsome nice stuff here, it's delicious,\r\nit's wonderful, it's it's, you know, it's.\r\nI was nibbling on it before,\r\nand it's just has such like a candy kinda\r\n[sniffs] Barney, but not like crazy,\r\nbut it's actually smells, it smells awesome.\r\nI'm really excited to what it's gonna do with the chilies.\r\nEspecially those habaneros, that tropical fruitiness\r\nkinda does wonderful things with a honey like this.\r\nOh god, smells so good.\r\nSo I'm just going to pour that over this,\r\nand then we'll let it mix around a little bit.\r\nAnd then I cover it with cheesecloth.\r\nI'm going to add the whole jar.\r\nAnd then you can nip at this all year, you know.\r\nAnd as it ferments, it'll, you know,\r\nthe peppers, they don't break down, but they get softer,\r\nand they wilt out, and they also will,\r\nit'll start to bubble.\r\nSo I just put cheese cloth over it\r\nbecause it will give off a bunch of gas and ferment.\r\nHoney, by its, you know, by nature,\r\nit's, you know, it never goes bad, right?\r\nYou might want to fact check that.\r\nBut I think it kind of just like never goes bad.\r\nIt's got its own like peroxide, it's a miracle.\r\nIt's because the bees take all the moisture out of it,\r\nand it's just like a nice little, you know,\r\na high sugar, or whatever else is in there, kind of thing.\r\nAnd no moisture makes sense.\r\nJust, it doesn't go bad, okay.\r\nThe, you know, the Egyptians, they, just Google it.\r\nSo I'm adding these chilies to it, which are,\r\nyou know, you're gonna do a little bit of its own\r\nlacto-ferment in there.\r\nSo just by the, all the microorganisms\r\nthat are in the honey, but then also\r\nthat are on the peppers.\r\nThey're gonna ferment in there.\r\nThey're gonna give off bubbles.\r\nThey're gonna get loose.\r\nThey're gonna give off the water\r\nthat's in the cell walls of the the pepper.\r\nAnd that'll make it for a much more looser consistency.\r\nAnd I mean, it's beautiful, look at that.\r\nGive it a nice stir,\r\nI just like to let the peppers mix around a bit.\r\nAnd you know, they can break up, you know,\r\nit doesn't have to keep super perfect rings.\r\nI don't really mind.\r\nJust like any ferment, you know, it's gonna,\r\nit's gonna happen faster in a warmer climate,\r\nor in a warmer place.\r\nSo, keep it somewhere where it's going to be around,\r\nyou know, anywhere from 60 to 75 degrees.\r\nAnd that's just really gonna determine how fast\r\nit takes to get to what you want it to be.\r\nSo that's it.\r\nOh, wow.\r\nOh. Whew! [coughs]\r\nHa!\r\nJust, you know, obviously,\r\nit's honey and chilies, but,\r\nsweet, but then just, you know,\r\njust that instant kind of habanero heat was there.\r\nPut a little cheesecloth on that.\r\nAlright, so we've got our honey all set up.\r\nThis one's gonna take about, you know, a week,\r\nSometimes two weeks, I go.\r\nIt's a little cooler these days.\r\nI like to push it a little bit, too, with the fermentation.\r\nReally let all the bubbles stop\r\nand kind of let it just mellow the garlic.\r\nWe'll get a nice little amber color.\r\nAll the peppers will kinda wilt down.\r\nPut that in a cool dark spot.\r\nYou know, somewhere over here,\r\nsomewhere over there, I don't know yet.\r\nMaybe up here, away from the kiddos.\r\nYou don't want kids getting this one, all right?\r\nGet in their eyes, ruin their day, get in their mouth.\r\nNothing about it's good for the kiddos,\r\nunless they're into that stuff and a little older.\r\nI do have a swap here, that's about, you know,\r\nabout six or seven days in, but can you,\r\nyou can tell how loose it is already.\r\nWe'll see how it is.\r\nI'm going to fry up a little chicken thighs,\r\nand that we'll get into that.\r\nLet these hang out and then let's get going.\r\nGet this baby hot. [engine starting]\r\nYeah, buddy.\r\nWe're gonna do a simple little flour, egg,\r\nbread crumb, little, you know,\r\nclassic little egg wash, little fry job.\r\nWe're gonna drizzle some hot chili honey on there.\r\nOh proper, oh God,\r\nsome real nice egg noodles or something.\r\nThat's what I'm talking about.\r\nCory, let's go to Italy.\r\nWe'll make raviolis.\r\nDrink funky little barn wine.\r\nLittle Italian guys with little fingers.\r\nFirst things first,\r\nthe flour.\r\nIt's just all purpose, flour, egg.\r\nSome people like to use a tong,\r\nI just wash my hands like every other time.\r\nAnd this was Panco, and I also added just some,\r\nlike, regular bread breadcrumbs to it, too.\r\nI'd say like a, like 23% regular breadcrumbs, seasoned.\r\nCory, you watching the new Sex and the City?\r\n[jazzy piano music]\r\nYou know, I'm not quite sure which one's, which,\r\nbut I like the, like, the older sassy one\r\nthat like, like, you know,\r\nI guess like slept around a lot.\r\nI guess that'd be her.\r\nI'd be a Samantha.\r\nIn case you don't know, Cory has a podcast\r\nall about Sex and the City.\r\nIt's called the Bradshaw Boys.\r\nMaybe you get it. I don't.\r\nJust some grandma style chicken.\r\nYou know what I'm saying?\r\nHow do you like that hood, Cory, right?\r\nGetting that smoke right out of there.\r\nYou guys are making fun of me because I\r\nhit my head on it all the time.\r\nBut boom, see you later.\r\nI got my crystal for good energy.\r\n[harp music]\r\n[retro music]\r\nIsn't that lovely, huh?\r\n[retro music]\r\nThis is the one we just started about 30 minutes ago.\r\nIt looks about the same.\r\nOkay.\r\nAnd here's the one we did about a week ago.\r\nSame kind of honey.\r\nLook at that, nice and loose.\r\nAlright, so this one's been going,\r\nand Captain Cory, he's been burping it,\r\nand babysitting it, let's see if there's any,\r\noh yeah, it had a little tss,\r\nI don't know if you picked that up,\r\neither way, you can tell, look, it's,\r\nit's starting to wilt out a bunch,\r\nand the big thing you can, you know,\r\nit's givin' off all of its own water.\r\nAnd as this is the one that's been fermented,\r\nand that gives off, you know,\r\nas it's doing its own lacto-fermentation,\r\nit's givin' off,\r\nthe peppers, have a lot of water in them as well.\r\nSo that's kind of leeching out into the honey,\r\nloosening it out.\r\nAnd if you keep watching it and then this'll get real\r\nbubbly and fermenty, and [sniffs]\r\njust smells, it smells incredible.\r\nSmells like a mixture of like a lacto-fermented hot sauce,\r\nmeets a sweet honey and, yeah, not mad about it.\r\nYeah, that's what you're looking for.\r\nGiving off gas, bubbles,\r\nand then ultimately a nice loosened out honey.\r\nThat's one week.\r\nI'll go another week on that one, two weeks total.\r\nBut again, it's always depending on the temperature,\r\nand the honey and the peppers, and the yada yada yada.\r\nPerfect.\r\nCome on.\r\nWho doesn't like that?\r\nA large population of the world.\r\nSo we go us, ooh, oh my god, there it is.\r\nGet it back in.\r\nA little chili mop.\r\nAlright, I'm going right in.\r\nI can't help it anymore.\r\nNope.\r\nMmm!\r\n[slaps counter]\r\nI just want to taste it by itself real quick, though.\r\nThat initial like Caspian, burn your mouth,\r\nfire really, really toned down.\r\nAnd what you're left with is those really pleasant,\r\ntropical floral notes from the pepper.\r\nThat's incredible.\r\nYou can go heavy on it, you know,\r\nyou can really put it on that chicken,\r\nand even a little bit of the pepper,\r\nput a little pepper on there.\r\nIt's really good.\r\nThat's such an easy thing to do,\r\nand the applications are great.\r\nI mean, that'd be great in a vinegarette,\r\nyou can put it in a sauce,\r\nSpicy candy drizzle.\r\nIt it's unbelievable.\r\nI think it would be phenomenal on fish,\r\nnot to be a squid hound,\r\nbut just great on some grilled squid.\r\nReally easy recipe.\r\nI mean, it's just chili and garlic and some honey.\r\nAnd get the best stuff you can,\r\nalways grow it if you can, even better.\r\nAnd tune in next time,\r\nwhen we do something cool at my house, again.\r\nWe're talking rooster talk,\r\nand I have, we had four of them,\r\nwhile I shot one and ate him.\r\nWe harvested one.\r\nAnd, and then the one, then there was one,\r\nhe's all, he's all matched up with the one,\r\nthe main hen that we got, the first hen that we got,\r\nand then the other new hens,\r\nthey kind of shacked up with the one real handsome,\r\nblack and white speckled one.\r\nAnd then the other one, he is like, man, I'm screwed,\r\nno one wants nothing to do with me.\r\nSo he ran across the street to our neighbors,\r\nand they, he's shacking up in there.\r\nHe's he's got the best thing going.\r\nHe's got like six or seven hens all over there by himself,\r\neating food, strutting around, no one messing with him.\r\nAnd yeah, my guy,\r\nI guess I don't remember where we were going with that.\r\n[chicken squawks]\r\n[lounge music]"

      "transcript": "Hey, I'm Devonn.\r\nI'm here in the BA Test Kitchen\r\nto have a secret conversation about Chris Morocco.\r\nOnce again,\r\nwe're here to put Chris' super-taster abilities to the test.\r\nThis is Aaron Sanchez's chiles rellenos\r\nwith vegetable picadillo.\r\nWe're challenging Chris to recreate this dish\r\nwith every ingredient in just one day.\r\nHe'll be able to taste it, touch it and smell it\r\nbut at no point,\r\nwill he be able to see this dish.\r\nAt the end of the day,\r\nwe'll come back to see his final creation\r\nand I'll be the judge.\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[Chris] Interesting.\r\nIt doesn't give me a lot.\r\nOh My God!\r\nI got so nervous for a second.\r\nIt felt like a lobster's antenna.\r\nI have a feeling, this is a Poblano chili.\r\nIt's been slit open\r\nand stuffed with something.\r\nIt has, like, kind of like narrow shoulders,\r\nlike a green bell pepper\r\nis going to be massively flared out across the top,\r\nyou know?\r\nWhereas a Poblano chili,\r\nit's a little bit skinnier and a little bit longer\r\nand more tapered.\r\nOkay.\r\nSo we've got like some kind of like\r\nzippy little sauce there.\r\nThat's got some heat to it.\r\nI think we've got some bad, out of season corn.\r\nThere's some cheese in there,\r\npossibly cotija.\r\nSomething kind of salty, tiny bit funky.\r\nIt's a very dispersed, this cheese.\r\nEverything is like very fine.\r\nThese like small little bits\r\nthat are kind of chewy, bouncy.\r\nI think it's some kind of like squeaky,\r\nsort of like queso,\r\nqueso fresco.\r\nThere seems to be some kind of like\r\naromatic group of ingredients around it.\r\nI'd say definitely onion.\r\nLet's say probably garlic as well.\r\nThey're these like little bits of things.\r\nIt feels like it could be perhaps like almond or walnut.\r\nIt also could be a seed, not a nut.\r\nWow.\r\nThis is a sauce that has,\r\nat its heart a lot of re-hydrated dried chilies.\r\nat its heart a lot of re-hydrated dried chilies.\r\nI feel like I'm getting like kind of dried oregano.\r\nI think the name of this dish is some kind of\r\nversion of chiles rellenos in mole.\r\nversion of chiles rellenos in mole.\r\nI could put a number of different names forward, you know,\r\nEnrique Olvera, Rick Bayless, Aaron Sanchez.\r\nEnrique Olvera, Rick Bayless, Aaron Sanchez.\r\nCool. Anyway,\r\nI think is going to be a fairly monumental challenge.\r\nThis is pretty much like my worst nightmare\r\nin terms of lots of things piled up\r\nand pureed and dumped all over each other.\r\nBut onward, we have to go.\r\nBut onward, we have to go.\r\nLet's time.\r\nSo we're working with the Chile first,\r\nand we're going to say Poblano chilies.\r\nFor the stuffing:\r\ncorn, maybe queso fresco,\r\nmaybe cotija,\r\nmaybe walnut, maybe almond, maybe onion.\r\nThere is some kind of sauciness to it,\r\nbut is that just,\r\nyou know, the kind of neutral oil\r\nand, you know,\r\nthe kind of juices that have come out of the corn\r\nand whatnot.\r\nOr is there something else going on in there?\r\nFor the sauce I have Morita, Pasilla, Chile Negro,\r\nWahaca chilies, Ancho chilies,\r\nonion, garlic, oregano, coriander, cumin,\r\nunsweetened cocoa powder, almonds, walnuts.\r\nYeah.\r\nI don't feel awesome about this one,\r\nbut here's my list.\r\nWe're going to shop it and then I'll have my first shot.\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\nI think maybe first things first,\r\nwe can just start by getting some chilies blistering.\r\nI think I'm going to do it on the stove top.\r\nThat's kind of the simplest approach.\r\nAll of this char is translating the flavor, right?\r\nIt's going to give you this kind of light, smoked,\r\nconcentrated intensity in the flavor.\r\nAll right,\r\nso the chilies are going into this bowl\r\nwhere they're going to steam out the rest of the way\r\nso that we can peel that kind of blistered skin off\r\nand just leave the flesh of the chili behind.\r\nWe're going to move on to the sauce.\r\nSo I've got cast iron getting hot\r\nbecause I believe these chilies are going\r\nto need to be toasted before getting re-hydrated.\r\nI need to take the stems and seeds of these chilies,\r\nmaybe two of these Moritas and then Ancho chillies,\r\nI'm leaning on a little bit more of like the darker,\r\nmore kind of brooding end of the spectrum.\r\nBut Ancho is great.\r\nIt provides you like,\r\nwith like quite a bit of bulk and not a lot of heat.\r\nSo these are going into a hot skillet,\r\nbut just enough to kind of wake up the flavor a little bit.\r\nAnd then they're going to go into a skillet with some water\r\nand they're going to soak.\r\nI think like we want to,\r\nmaybe toast our nuts\r\nmaybe toast our nuts\r\nthat we're going to use in this.\r\nNext step is gonna be our cumin and our coriander,\r\njust gonna get a little toast\r\nand then it's going to get grounded.\r\nNow it's time to really build to what in my mind\r\nis sort of the aromatic base of the sauce,\r\nwhich I think, you know,\r\nwe need to sweat out some onion\r\nand maybe sweat out some garlic as well.\r\nI want to put in maybe like half of these spices,\r\nplus our oregano.\r\nAll right.\r\nSo we've got aromatics going into the blender.\r\n[blender sound effect]\r\nIt's also looking like real f**king thick in there.\r\nLike nuts are only going to make it thicker still.\r\n[blender sound effect]\r\nThere's no great way to saY this.\r\nWe're not looking so good here.\r\nIt has a lot of chili flavor,\r\nbut not necessarily a whole lot else going on,\r\nbut I'm wondering if this is where,\r\nthe cocoa powder can come in\r\nand deepen things still further.\r\nSo this is a sauce that does not really have much sweetness\r\nat all, at least that I can discern.\r\nCocoa powder is going to deepen it\r\nand kind of help kind of bring out that bitter edge.\r\nI don't know that it like improved anything.\r\nThis is okay.\r\nFor the filling I need to grind up some\r\nof these almonds.\r\nFinely chopped onion,\r\ngarlic,\r\ncut the corn off the cobs here.\r\nThat's the garlic and onion going in.\r\nSalt.\r\nIt just doesn't feel like I have enough ingredients\r\nfor the filling of the Chile.\r\nSo we've got queso fresco and Cotija.\r\nSo I was kind of getting this like bit of texture\r\nin the filling, could be Cotija\r\nand not, you know,\r\na kind of ground nut at all.\r\nI mean, it's nice.\r\nIt's fine.\r\nYou know, I don't know if it's the dish.\r\nI'm gonna grab our chilies\r\nand I'm just trying to open it up\r\nand also kind of get the seeds out of it.\r\nI felt like there was a pool of sauce\r\nand then there was a chili sitting in it\r\nand that's what I'm trying to achieve here.\r\nSo we need to fill the chili.\r\nYou can't go too crazy.\r\nIt's only gonna hold so much.\r\nI don't know.\r\nHere.\r\nHere we go.\r\nGreat.\r\nEverything feels wrong.\r\nThis is version one.\r\nI'm just not really certain about the flavors\r\nthat are going on in the stuffing,\r\nbeyond the simple fact of there being corn\r\nand some kind of cheese in there.\r\nThe sauce.\r\nYeah.\r\nWe're in like the right universe.\r\nSure.\r\nBut the right solar system, maybe not.\r\nIngredients,\r\nI would give myself maybe a 65%.\r\nI think this sauce could have easily 15 more things in it.\r\nAnd I might never even know.\r\nTechnique, maybe 70%, you know?\r\nTechnique, maybe 70%, you know?\r\nJust for the simple fact that it's a blistered Chile\r\nin a sauce that got pureed at some point,\r\nand that has some ingredients in it.\r\nMaybe this is the one area where I'd go bold\r\nand say 80% for appearance.\r\nOkay.\r\nAnd in terms of taste,\r\nI'm going to have a go at it now.\r\nMy sauce is, is on the fruitier end of things.\r\nThat feels a little bit cold.\r\nI feel like the original sauce was just so much deeper\r\nand richer.\r\nFor taste I'll go with 70%.\r\n71% overall.\r\nThat's not great.\r\nAll right.\r\nSo these are my actual scores on this piece of paper\r\nthat I'm gonna look at now.\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n0oh!\r\n0oh!\r\n0oh! I see.\r\nThis is exactly what I thought might happen.\r\nAll right. So actual score for ingredients is 39%.\r\nTechnique is 54%.\r\nAppearance is 68%.\r\nTaste is 35%.\r\nThat brings me to an average of 49%.\r\nSee, I told you it wasn't going to be okay.\r\nI'd be curious to see if there's some other element\r\nthat I just missed in its entirety.\r\nI feel like this is like the worst, you know,\r\nfirst half of like any of these games I've played,\r\nI think so much is riding\r\non the second tasting of the original dish.\r\nLike it's actually freaking me out a little bit.\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\n[dramatic orchestral music]\r\nSo it's like we have like the opening on top.\r\nSome kind of like nutty cheesy something.\r\nIt was like very salty, very, you know,\r\nkind of pungent sort of cheesy flavor.\r\nI don't think it's like a pepita.\r\nThink I might've just gotten,\r\nlike a little piece of cilantro.\r\nThere's a lightness to the texture of the sauce.\r\nPerhaps being like less chile forward\r\nthan mine was.\r\nThis one is kind of killing me a little bit.\r\nI gotta be totally honest. This mouthfeel.\r\nIt's not, it's not quite the silky pillow-ness\r\nof the sauce that I did.\r\nThis sauce feels like the body is coming\r\nfrom something else.\r\nSo we learned,\r\nI'm like pretty far off with the sauce\r\nin terms of where I came in with my first version,\r\nwe also learned that I don't know\r\nhow exactly to make it better\r\nand that's not a place you want to be\r\nin the second tasting.\r\nI've like never sat down in this show,\r\nyou know?\r\nJust like get comfortable because we're not going anywhere\r\nfor a f**king while.\r\nI've come up with three new ingredients.\r\nDespite the fact that I'm looking at a 60 point deficit\r\nand- [laughing]\r\nthat's not great.\r\n[Man] What else could be in the sauce?\r\n[Chris] Things that are really dark.\r\nThat belong in a Mexican pantry.\r\nBe like, Chris, you need to like do a different show, man!\r\n[laughing]\r\nMy producers informed me that I need\r\nto start doing something\r\nand stop sitting on this apple crate.\r\nSo to that end, like I need to start doing something.\r\nSo I better go do that.\r\nSo here is Round Two.\r\nThe Poblano chile is good as it is.\r\nI still like the Pasilla chile.\r\nBut I think I'm going to try a mix of\r\nlike Pasilla and Guajillo\r\nand take out the Morita and Ancho.\r\nWe're just looking to deepen the flavor\r\nof the almond and walnut.\r\nJust not leave it quite so raw tasting here.\r\nWe're just going to add a little pile of sesame\r\non there too.\r\nSticking with onion and garlic,\r\ncreate a little aromatic base for this sauce.\r\nSo we've got cumin, coriander.\r\nWe're switching to Mexican oregano.\r\nI don't work with it that much.\r\nTo me, it's a little brighter,\r\nlike little sharper.\r\nThis time. I'm going to try re-hydrating the chilies\r\nin with the aromatic base.\r\nAlong with some water.\r\nI might even say f**k it\r\nand throw some tomato paste in there.\r\nWe're looking for something else.\r\nThis is something else.\r\nI'm gonna use this to add body,\r\nboth to the sauce and to the corn mixture.\r\nboth to the sauce and to the corn mixture.\r\nNow we're going to work on the filling.\r\nCorn is going in,\r\na little bit of tomato.\r\nI'm just trying to think of something\r\nthat you can add in on top of that veg,\r\nthat's going to cook out\r\nto the barest kind of glimmer\r\nof sauce like consistency.\r\nSo we're getting our cheese and our corn mixture here,\r\nand then I need to get some cilantro in there.\r\nThat's a different color.\r\nCertain things changed.\r\nI mean a little bit, right?\r\nOkay.\r\nThere is Round Two.\r\nMaybe a little closer.\r\nProbably not.\r\nIn terms of ingredients.\r\nI'd say maybe I pulled my way up to like a 59% now.\r\nNo, you know what?\r\nLet's just say like an ingredient wise, I'm at a 50%.\r\nTechnique, 75%.\r\nAppearance, maybe I got a bit closer.\r\nMaybe we're at like an 80% now or something.\r\nTaste, like maybe\r\nif we could even get up to like a 60%\r\nthat would be brilliant.\r\nWell, right or wrong,\r\nthis is the dish I have to put in front of the judge.\r\nSo obviously you hope a few things broke your way,\r\nyou know?\r\nIn the journey, but let's face it.\r\nMaybe not.\r\n[Chris] Hey Devonn.\r\n[Devonn] Hello.\r\nI think you saw my face earlier.\r\nYeah.\r\nAnd what did you see in my face?\r\nThere was a little bit of dread.\r\nA longing for answers.\r\nYes. That's true.\r\nDo you feel like today you were tasting with your heart\r\nor your head?\r\nI don't think I was tasting with anything.\r\n[laughing]\r\nI mean, I think I was like tasting with like my right elbow.\r\nGot it, got it.\r\nYou know? Got it.\r\nDo you have a guess of the name of who made the dish\r\nand the name of the dish?\r\nI thought this was some kind of combination\r\nof like mole chiles rellenos\r\nor just reorder those a few different ways, you know?\r\nSomething like that.\r\nOkay.\r\nChris, may I present to you Aaron Sanchez's chiles rellenos\r\nwith vegetable picadillo.\r\nVegetable picadillo.\r\nAlready, like the picadillo, you know,\r\njust like the fact of the name is putting me\r\nin a certain like mind frame.\r\nThe mixture is a cilantro and cotija pesto.\r\nBut it has pumpkin seeds in it.\r\n[Chris] It is pepitas, God.\r\n[Devonn] There is basil in the pesto as well.\r\nPumpkin seeds get toasted.\r\nEverything else gets thrown in the food processor\r\nand just blend it together.\r\nIs there black bean in that?\r\nThere is indeed a black bean sauce moment\r\nin the sauce.\r\nYou can tell, just from like color, you know,\r\nhow black beans take on,\r\nit's like almost like a purple-y brown.\r\n[Devonn] For sure.\r\nNot being able to see that\r\nand knowing that there was some thickness and richness,\r\ncoming from something that was-\r\nplus a texture of sorts.\r\nSo all in all,\r\nI think that we should absolutely taste this.\r\nAre you ready to take the plunge?\r\nOh yeah, let's do it.\r\nCool.\r\nLet's taste the original first, I think.\r\nThere's like a texture in there.\r\nThere's also so much f**king oregano in there.\r\nHave you ever tasted that much dried oregano?\r\n[Devonn] It definitely like, taking you to a place.\r\nYeah, I dunno.\r\nI don't like perceive it on the pallet\r\nas being like a product of like beans something.\r\nI still would like,\r\nif I close my eyes and be like, oh yeah,\r\nlike there's some kind of like thickening agent,\r\nbut I wouldn't put it on bean.\r\nOkay. Go onto mine.\r\nListen it's yeah, I didn't, I didn't,\r\nListen it's yeah, I didn't, I didn't,\r\nI didn't quite close the gap on this one.\r\nI think the hard part for me was like,\r\nif I could have tasted\r\nthat little like saucy pesto on its own,\r\nit would have been a completely different ballgame\r\nin terms of the filling.\r\nAnd I think that my mind made me believe\r\nthat this was mole and it just totally is not.\r\nYeah.\r\nI mean, listen,\r\nI see where the roundness and earthiness,\r\nI see like where it maybe came up.\r\nI think that like,\r\njust where it's placed is also, it's tricky. Right?\r\nThere's like four, maybe five even very major components.\r\nSo I think it's just like where those things went. Right?\r\nSo in ingredients you gave yourself a 50%.\r\nYeah.\r\nI would probably say it's leaning more towards\r\nlike a 49% for me.\r\nSo technique.\r\nThis is, I mean, kind of got there, the few things.\r\nI think that the mole slowed you down.\r\nOriginally you had said 75%.\r\nIn this moment,\r\nI'm going to say a 60% for technique.\r\nIt's, what we're looking at is pretty different here.\r\nI mean, that's more than fair.\r\nFor appearance,\r\nyou gave yourself an 80% and you know what?\r\nI'm kind of into that.\r\nI'm gonna say a 79%,\r\nsimply because of the mole misstep.\r\nsimply because of the mole misstep.\r\nFor taste,\r\nI am going to have to say it's a 56% for me.\r\nI am going to have to say it's a 56% for me.\r\nAnd this is mostly just like a proportion thing.\r\nLike where smokiness was,\r\nwhere the lack of the folding\r\nof the fresh urban sauce\r\ninto the picadillo at the end.\r\nOtherwise, you know what?\r\nI am actually going to finish this.\r\nSo really, we both win.\r\nI get to eat. You got to experience this moment.\r\nYeah!\r\nWell thank you so much for hanging out today.\r\nThank you for having me.\r\nThis was fun.\r\nThis is, yeah, this was hard.\r\nThis is a really hard one.\r\nI walk away with a renewed sense of humility.\r\nI walk away with a renewed sense of humility.\r\nYou know?\r\nI'm actually like walking away, pretty happy from this\r\nlike that cortado and like that like 20 minutes sit down,\r\nlike crisis freak out,\r\nreally did a lot, you know?\r\nSometimes you have to take a minute\r\nand just take stock\r\nand like re-energize, and I'm not saying that like,\r\nthings like went that much better from there,\r\nbut I came in with a dish.\r\nI got to the finish line.\r\nSo, all right.\r\nFair play to you Aaron.\r\nSorry.\r\nI like completely butchered your food."

      "transcript": "I agree- Right behind you Jeff.\r\nWhat, don't sneak up on me like that.\r\nI'm floating around.\r\nI get a little excited and I start throwing arms around.\r\nI've overstimulated you.\r\nI am a little overstimulated.\r\nOh, you want us to make cake? [laughs]\r\nHey guys, I'm Bradley Leone.\r\nWe're here in the test kitchen with Jeff Goldblum\r\nand today we're gonna be making a birthday cake\r\nconstructed on this stand.\r\nWe're gonna bring out a bunch of the components\r\nfrom you know, what the base of the cake, frosting,\r\ntoppings, yada, yada, yada.\r\nAnd we're gonna make one together Jeff.\r\nI can't wait.\r\nDo you like cake first of all?\r\nWell, I like food, I'm easy to please.\r\nYour field, I won't talk to you about every little thing,\r\nbut cake, it's just the word.\r\nI love that, that's the name of my production company.\r\nCake pictures, did you know that?\r\nI did not.\r\nNo, it's not true.\r\nOh.\r\nWell I just made that up, but cake, I love cake.\r\nWhy don't you pull the curtain off?\r\nWe got our-\r\nWell said, well done, ready,\r\nready, one, two, three.\r\nOoh, well done with panache.\r\nHey, that's beautiful.\r\nI had not seen that.\r\nSo as far as basis, we got the classic, you know,\r\npeople really get into.\r\nI'm guessing, is that a devil's,\r\na cranberry cake.\r\nThat's a strawberry or raspberry,\r\nthat's a pumegranate cake.\r\nI like where your head's at.\r\nI kinda think that would even be a little better,\r\nbut it's the red velvet.\r\nSo it's kind of like a chocolate base\r\nwith some red food dye in it.\r\nThis, that looks like a beautiful walnut.\r\nWell give it a scratch and sniff,\r\nyeah, a little scratch and sniff on that one.\r\nWalnuts is the classic topping mixture that goes with it.\r\nI love walnuts.\r\nBut that's yeah, I mean, it's a carrot cake.\r\nIt's carrot, I love carrot cake for sure.\r\nAnd then number three here,\r\nyou know, it's got a classic, you know, vanilla base.\r\nEverything is classic to you.\r\nYou've called each of these classics so far I believe.\r\nWell they're of like in the world of cakes,\r\nyou know, it's not like a persimmons cake,\r\nbut we have a coffee, that's what that is.\r\nHey, by the way, this is a coffee cake?\r\nCoffee cake, yep, so it's just like the classic yellow,\r\nbut then with the coffee flavor.\r\nIt's not really classic already.\r\nClassic coffee cake, hey have a nice, have some coffee cake,\r\nI haven't even heard that for quite a while.\r\nIs there coffee in it?\r\nThere's a little, so I don't think\r\nwe're gonna go that route.\r\nWhy not, I love-\r\nWell, you don't drink coffee Jeff.\r\nWell I don't drink it but I'll have-\r\nBut I'll east it.\r\nCoffee ice cream, how much caffeine are you getting\r\nin that cake?\r\nMinuscule amounts.\r\n. It's like a rum dessert.\r\nRight, you're not getting drunk.\r\nI know, no, you're not getting drunk.\r\nI'll have a rum dessert.\r\nSo that's coffee cake, oh yeah, yeah, coffee cake.\r\nOur final classic is-\r\nThis looks festive.\r\nIt is. It's a birthday cake.\r\nIf you can see it, oh yeah.\r\nIt's multicolored, it looks like a fruit cake.\r\nSo this is-\r\nFunfetti.\r\nI see what you've done, it's not confetti, it's funfetti.\r\nIt's way cooler than confetti.\r\nAnd I don't know how you've achieved the multi-colored,\r\nso it's not a fruit cake, what is all that?\r\nIt's just like little sugary kind of sprinkles in there.\r\nThe flat ones though, classics.\r\nWell what else is in the front?\r\nWhat's the basis of the funfetti?\r\nI know the-\r\nYou got classic, vanilla, yellow cake.\r\nNo, I'm sorry, I blew that, it's just a yellow cake.\r\nYou know, So it's basically flavorless white cake\r\nthat they probably, oh no, actually sorry, rewind.\r\nThe classic white, doesn't have egg yolks in it.\r\nAnd a classic yellow cake has egg yolks in it,\r\nwhich is where they get the color yellow from.\r\nBefore you pick one, we have to pick our doyle.\r\nDoilies, what are they called?\r\nDoyle, Doyle, the friends of Eddie Doyle.\r\nNobody calls this doyles.\r\nNo.\r\nWhat do you call them?\r\nYou're not who you say you are.\r\nYou know nothing about kitchens or anything about food.\r\nIs that true?\r\nYes it is true.\r\nAdmit it now, I would go because Goldblum, I'm gold,\r\nI'd say the gold.\r\nSo gold doyle.\r\nGold doyle.\r\nWhich I think fits perfect.\r\nWhich cake do you wanna use?\r\nWell here, as you say, we can do,\r\nwell, we can do one, two, three.\r\nWe gotta leave one out if we mix and match.\r\nI don't wanna leave anybody out but-\r\nWhat we got then?\r\nOh, coffee cake, red.\r\nIf this is red food dye, as you say.\r\nIt is, it is, I'm not going to lie to you Jeff,\r\nI'm not that kinda guy.\r\nThen you know what, then out with the,\r\nalthough chocolate is great, it's a chocolate cake\r\nand it's, would you call that devil's food?\r\nNo.\r\nSo I'd say one from this, one from this,\r\nand one from this.\r\nOkay, okay, good.\r\nOkay, so the bottom, let's do this,\r\n'cause this looked like a smudge of something,\r\nand that, but that's the, tell me that again, that's a-\r\nThat's coffee.\r\nThat's coffee.\r\nIt dense right, I think it's a good foundation.\r\nDense, good foundation.\r\nGood foundation for our structure.\r\nAnd the next, you say funfetti on top,\r\nso then throw the old carrot.\r\nYeah, that's right, ah, the carrot in the middle,\r\ncarrot in the middle.\r\nSo just to give it a little small tug.\r\nOh, beautiful, beautiful cakes.\r\nBeautiful cakes, thank you.\r\nGreat job, and then we'll finish it\r\nwith a little fun right.\r\nWell, let's pull the cover off this mystery, Jeff,\r\nand you know, me being the host and you, my guest,\r\nyou have to do that.\r\nOkay, if I have to, I have to.\r\nGently, it can be balls of spiders, we don't know.\r\nOh, why would you bring that up?\r\nBalls of spiders.\r\nThis looks absolutely beautiful.\r\nIt looks very sweet.\r\nOkay, it looks like we have a little bit\r\nof a chocolate ganache, a little chocolate drizzle kind of-\r\nWhat'd you say, ganache?\r\nGanache.\r\nI've never heard that, ganache?\r\nYeah, you can google that one.\r\nThis looks like a raspberry jam.\r\nIt does, I love raspberry.\r\nSweet almond mars, are plenty, I'm very-\r\nCrazy about that.\r\nYeah, it's got its place in time.\r\nAnd then here it looks like we have\r\na little bit of a lemon custard.\r\nLemon custard, anything called custard.\r\nGrab a spoon if you wanna taste anything,\r\nI gotta dip that.\r\nOkay, this, I'll just taste everything.\r\nYeah, that's sketchy huh?\r\nIt's sweet and tart, sweet and tart just like you.\r\nThat's for sure.\r\nThat we know, what else?\r\nWhat's that?\r\nOh boy.\r\nIt's like a sweetened rum.\r\nRight, is there sugar added to that?\r\nAh, god.\r\nJust a rum, I don't need it.\r\nBooze, I'm not a boozer.\r\nI don't know, yeah you're not getting drunk.\r\nI'll have a rum dessert.\r\nSo if you had to pick one of these Jeff,\r\nI mean, we don't have to, this is our birthday, right?\r\nThis is our cake.\r\nIt's our birthday, we can cry if we want to.\r\nWhat movie is that from Jeff?\r\nIt can happen to you.\r\nHe don't know.\r\nI'm kind of leaned to, I love maybe a thin,\r\nthin coating of the almond.\r\nLove it.\r\nAnd then a little chocolate and raspberry.\r\nYeah, leave the lemon out of it.\r\nLeave the rum out of it, three.\r\nYeah, absolutely, absolutely.\r\nLet's start with the base here, with the bottom,\r\nyou grabbed the offset spatula, and the I'm thinking-\r\nWhat'd you call this?\r\nOffset spatula.\r\nI never heard that before,\r\nwhat's an offset spatula?\r\nWe'll learn it together, in the baking world,\r\nit's what they use for, you know, stuff like this.\r\nNice to know, okay.\r\nA little bit of off-\r\nAre we ever gonna do that thing with a thing?\r\nOh, is that what that's called?\r\nStick with me Jeff.\r\nI always wanted to do that.\r\nOh, you're gonna.\r\nOkay, well what goes with coffee?\r\nIf this is coffee,\r\nlet's just say what goes with coffee?\r\nAh, almond, well almond, what do you call that?\r\nAlmond and coffee is, you know, amaretto or-\r\nI guess we kind of go both ways with that but-\r\nYeah raspberry, no.\r\nAnd go chocolate, yeah, what you said,\r\nchocolate and coffee sounds right.\r\nA thin layer of chocolate, should I do it?\r\nYeah get in there.\r\nWow, okay, where's my cooking show?\r\nI shouldn't have a cooking show.\r\nI bet you will-\r\nYou see that?\r\nYou see how, what happened there?\r\nWe freshen it up a little bit.\r\nSo now I'd say glob it on there, and then spread it around.\r\nOh you already know Jeff.\r\nRight, and then well, you know, I buttered toast before.\r\nThat looks good, check this little jazzy trick out.\r\nOh, that's like a lazy Susan.\r\nNow that's a team, that's a team.\r\nLook, that's good.\r\nBeautiful, I'm kinda into that, huh?\r\nBeautiful.\r\nAnd then next we'll put down,\r\nback down our carrot cake all right?\r\nAll right, you can't eat the cardboard.\r\nNo you can but it ain't going to be too desirable\r\nin texture or flavor.\r\nNo, now we're doing something to the top of that.\r\nNow you say, well here's what I'd say-\r\nGotta be honest Jeff, what else are we gonna do?\r\nYeah, yes, I think you're right.\r\nAnd one reason I think you're right is not only\r\nbecause the walnut, this is coffee cake, oh yeah.\r\nNo, this is the-\r\nCarrot cake, carrot cake.\r\nWith the walnuts.\r\nOh yes, almond, walnuts, absolutely perfect.\r\nAnd I think on top of the funfetti,\r\nthe raspberry will be festive looking.\r\nBright color, sharp, tart, sweet, zing, zang.\r\nZing zang, that was,\r\nyes, that's right, okay.\r\nSo cross contaminating with the chocolate.\r\nOh oh, did I do bad?\r\nNo I don't mind, someone's gonna be like\r\nJeff put the chocolate thing in the almond thing.\r\nWell, you know, some people are like that.\r\nOkay, so, boy this is-\r\nYeah, get that bad Larry right on there.\r\nThat's pasty.\r\nDid you say bad...\r\nThere's a bad Larry, right there?\r\nBad Larry, I've heard, where's he come up with these?\r\nYou're perfect, I've heard, you know the bad boy,\r\nwhich I think is overused.\r\nDon't anybody say should be a moratorium on,\r\nHey, put that bad boy.\r\nI don't like it, I never particularly liked it.\r\nWe're gonna cut this bad boy in half,\r\nbad boys, bad boys.\r\nThese bad boys are big, we're gonna drop these bad boys in,\r\nlook at this bad boy.\r\nI wouldn't replace it with bad Larry.\r\nWell bad Larry on there.\r\nI would put bad Larry in its place.\r\nSo is that thin enough?\r\nYou don't want too much of this.\r\nNot too much, I would put a little dabble doodle there.\r\nThis is like a little dabble doodle.\r\nLet me do the honors.\r\nYeah, you pop that baby on there.\r\nRemember, I think it's a little sticky on the bottom.\r\nYou're gonna wanna do a little-\r\nI'm sticky on the bottom, so what.\r\nActually clean, clean take.\r\nI'm clean on the bottom.\r\nYeah, there we go.\r\nThat's what I've heard about you.\r\nClean take Jeff.\r\nClean take.\r\nThat look kinda good bud.\r\nDo we wanna put something?\r\nNo, no, I think we're getting into the world of,\r\nwhich kind of-\r\nWait, well this was our plan,\r\nbut wait a minute, if you want now that it's there,\r\nif you wanna jet put of it, listen-\r\nLets just pump the breaks real quick,\r\n'cause if we're gonna maybe put a frosting.\r\nWell, now what you call, what we did\r\nis filling, it's whatever you put it in there\r\nit's called filling.\r\nWhatever we put on top is now frosting,\r\nis that right or no?\r\nI kinda like that.\r\nI love it.\r\nI say we put that on there,\r\nand then we take your wife's route\r\nand we try to just put some frosting on the outside\r\nand keep a jam top, keep it fun.\r\nSounds good to me.\r\nRight.\r\nThat sounds good to me.\r\nNo, one's doing that yet Jeff.\r\nOh I like what you did there.\r\nLook, let's both go at this, look at that.\r\nOh, it takes two-\r\nIt does.\r\nTo jam it up.\r\nThat looks like the right thing to do.\r\nJam it up Brad, I like what we've done here.\r\nAll the way to the edge Jeff.\r\nOkay, oh yeah.\r\nAll right Jeff, we have our, I mean basically\r\nwe have our base, everything all set up right.\r\nWe have our filling, our three layers of cake.\r\nNow we're gonna do a little frosting.\r\nWell, here it goes, I'm just frightened.\r\nReady, what happened to the drum roll.\r\nThis is where it's applicable. [drum rolls]\r\nOh my god, oh, this looks good to me already.\r\nSo this looks, right off the bat,\r\nI'm gonna say this is a-\r\nMarshmallow.\r\nA meringue base.\r\nMeringue based.\r\nRight, taking like egg white,\r\nbeating it into a peak where it can hold some shape.\r\nAnd then I'm assuming that this is like\r\na boiled, what do they call, a boiled frosting.\r\nIt isn't, boiled frosting?\r\nBoiled crossing, I think is the name\r\nof this type of frost.\r\nIs that true?\r\nYou bring a sugar solution,\r\na sugar solution until it's melted\r\nand then you pour it over an egg white,\r\nripped into like a peak where it can hold shape\r\nand you mix it in, mix it in until you get this.\r\nIt's very marshmallowy.\r\nRight, fine, sweet, I feel like I'm getting a little-\r\nThat's delicious, I do like a meringue too.\r\nLove a meringue.\r\nLet's dive right in there, and I think that's Swiss,\r\nthat's a Swiss-\r\nFamily Robinson.\r\nA Swiss buttercream.\r\nOh yes, I taste that butter cream.\r\nYou get the butter.\r\nHey, that's great.\r\nYou know, all this is devilishly-\r\nIt's good stuff right?\r\nYeah, it's great, I mean, it's great.\r\nI like that.\r\nYou love that.\r\nThat's gotta be sour cream, or no cream cheese.\r\nI like a cream cheese.\r\nAnd then finally this one.\r\nWell very, is that raspberry or strawberry?\r\nStrawberry.\r\nStrawberry, yes, probably.\r\nIt's strawberry, beaten into an American buttercream.\r\nOh really?\r\nNot bad.\r\nI love them all, this has so many flavors of course.\r\nAnd colors, visually that, we may as well,\r\nas long as we've invited everybody to the party-\r\nQuad it out.\r\nYeah, you know, I'd put some here, some there.\r\nYou'd build a quadrant?\r\nYeah, I'd put them all in, I'd put them all in.\r\nI like it, at this point why not?\r\nI'm mop that right on there.\r\nThis is good.\r\nAll right Jeff.\r\n.

      "transcript": "Sometimes you're juggling,\r\ndo I really want this beautiful one thing\r\nthat I can maybe only really have for two or three weeks?\r\nIt's not really romantic,\r\ncooking with all bunch of bruised stuff,\r\nbut I also wanna have a business\r\nthat is not just about an exchange of food for money.\r\nHey guys, I'm chef Greg Baxtrom,\r\nowner of Olmsted and Maison Yaki across the street.\r\nWhy don't you head inside and follow me around for the day?\r\n[timer beeps]\r\nAll right, so it's 9:00 am.\r\nThis is usually when I cover the farmer's market.\r\nI like to come to see what's the best produce to work with\r\nright now on the menu.\r\nSup chef?\r\nWe're at Norwich Meadows Farms,\r\ntheir thing is that they are the largest organic farm\r\nat the farmer's market.\r\nSo when I first get to Norwich,\r\nI usually check in with Zaid and Haifa,\r\nthe owners of the farm.\r\nZaid and I approach shopping together\r\na couple of different ways.\r\nOne is just, what do we need for the menu\r\nthat we're currently running?\r\nThe other is what's on the farm that's not selling,\r\nor what did he bring too much of to the market\r\nthat he's starting to feel like isn't gonna sell,\r\nor that could just end up in the trash, or in the compost?\r\nIn sort of a way to mutually benefit\r\nI try to purchase those things to sort of reduce food waste\r\nand to still be putting a great organic product on the menu.\r\nWe've got a whole bunch of rutabaga\r\nfor the rutabaga pasta dish that we run.\r\nWe're gonna get kohlrabi,\r\nand then bok choy for Maison Yaki.\r\nSo we're buying for both restaurants right now.\r\nAll right, so it's about 10:30,\r\nit's time for me to get back to the restaurant.\r\nI have everything I need from the farm\r\nand we're gonna head back to Brooklyn.\r\n[timer beeping]\r\n[chill music]\r\nOlmsted, we're about six years old.\r\nWe did not have a lot of money to open up this restaurant.\r\nAnd my dad is a carpenter and I can clean pretty well,\r\nso we just kind of together did whatever we could.\r\nSo like the bookshelf over the bar,\r\nthe whole chef's counter, everything,\r\nthe redoing the tables, he did it all.\r\nThere's a charm to Olmsted\r\nand I feel like a lot of that has to do with sort of\r\nthis humble beginning thing that was started with my dad\r\nand I just kind of doing all the work ourselves.\r\nThe chef's counter down and at the end\r\nis literally framed out with barn wood,\r\nfrom a barn that I used to play with my brother,\r\nand we would jump out of the second floor\r\nand like play tag and hide and seek out of it\r\nand that's what the chef's counter is built out of.\r\nAnd then the garden kinda has a lot of similar\r\ncomponents to that.\r\n[timer beeping]\r\nIt's 11:00 am, it's time for me to check in with the cooks.\r\n[door squeaking]\r\nSo we have two kitchens now.\r\nThis is the prep kitchen, this is the newer kitchen.\r\nBecause our other restaurant, Maison Yaki,\r\nis just across the street what we do\r\nis we basically prep everything\r\nfor both restaurants right here,\r\nand then everyone kinda breaks off to their line.\r\nSo it's just sort of easier because there's more combies,\r\nthere's more firepower in these ones\r\nthan the other small service kitchens.\r\nUsually the first two hours of the line cook's day\r\nis here knocking out prep,\r\nand then going over to the hotline.\r\nWhen we first opened,\r\nthis was all we had was this small little thing.\r\nThis is the pass, this is where all the food gets plated.\r\nWe call this the meat station, the fish station,\r\nand the garnishee station.\r\nBut it's just sort of for show,\r\nit's just kind of like whatever can be made with a fryer\r\nand the four burner stove gets made over here\r\nor whatever can be made with a salamander and the flattop\r\nis made here.\r\nWe've set up a grill,\r\nwhatever can be made with a grill\r\nand an oven gets made there.\r\nIt's a small kitchen but it's efficient.\r\n[timer beeps]\r\nI love duck, which is why it's always on the menu.\r\nThe best thing that you can do for a duck\r\nis not like some fancy recipe.\r\nYou can just have it be 14 days old.\r\nAnd I know that that that kind of sounds weird\r\nbut what happens is there is a ton of water in this fat.\r\nAnd by giving it some uncovered time in a refrigerator,\r\nthe water starts to evaporate and it forms a little skin\r\nand that's how you get really crispy skin on the duck.\r\nAnd so normally what you would do\r\nis you would take the whole thing\r\nand the whole thing would be 14 days.\r\nBut because we use so much duck in this restaurant\r\nand we are fortunately busy,\r\nwe don't have storage space for these whole ducks.\r\nSo we break it down into all of its parts\r\nand then just the breast gets aged for 14 days.\r\nEverything else gets turned into liver mousse or duck fat\r\nor whatever we wanna do with it.\r\nYou know, we have our whole ducks,\r\nwe need to break it down into like a million pieces.\r\nThey always come with their necks, which we use to stack.\r\nThey typically come with some awful livers and hearts,\r\nsometimes gizzards.\r\nSo the livers get turned into a mousse that we use\r\nthe hearts a lot of the times,\r\nI like to turn them into corn beef.\r\nAnd then we skewer them\r\nand then serve them as a skewer special across the street\r\nat the French restaurant.\r\nSo it's no different than breaking down a chicken.\r\nYou break its legs,\r\nyou use its own weight to do the work for you.\r\nSo now there's just this guy here.\r\nSometimes you just kind of pinch it, right?\r\nAnd now it's separated on both sides.\r\nThe trick that I was taught about butchering\r\nbut in general, but specifically bars this,\r\nyou count how many strokes\r\nit takes you to get something off the carcass\r\nand then you just kind of keep reducing that\r\nas you get better.\r\nAnd then you'll have less knife marks on there\r\nand you'll have this sort of beautiful breast.\r\nSometimes we'll use the wings for a special\r\nbut if we're really in need of a lot of sauce,\r\nwe'll just use the wings to make a stock.\r\nSo we'll get a little bit more sauce out of it.\r\nThe fat comes off.\r\nSo these will just get roasted\r\nand that's sort of it for the ducks.\r\nSo it turns out that we're actually making liver mousse,\r\nduck liver mousse today.\r\nEvery ingredient for the liver mousse has been grammed out\r\nfrom the spice blend, the salt, sugar,\r\nand the pink salt to deliver themselves.\r\nBags, melted butter, it's a lot.\r\nTake one of each and blend it and then strain it.\r\nOur mousse is more like a custard.\r\nWe made a recipe that makes it really\r\nlike even if you're not a liver person,\r\nyou'll like this liver.\r\nYou can see that they're rendering duck over here.\r\nThey're making duck fat French fries for a family meal.\r\nChef Sherry is working on a new dish.\r\nThat's gonna have sort of like a beat crape\r\nking crab and caviar\r\nand we're gonna run it at a special night in Seattle.\r\nPeople like it.\r\nSometimes we just get samples in\r\nor we'll have something that's left over\r\nfrom the menu change.\r\nIt'll be a small amount of something,\r\nnot enough to run a whole night worth\r\nor really a full menu change,\r\nbut it's enough to kind of play around with.\r\nSo in this case,\r\nwe had a private event\r\nand they requested caviar and king crab legs.\r\nSo we have a little bit of that leftover.\r\nSo we're playing around\r\nwith something that could just be run tonight as a special\r\nor maybe we'll love it\r\nand then it'll be on the menu next week.\r\nBut it's just sort of a creative outlet\r\nfor some of the stronger members of the team\r\nto be able to play around with some ingredients basically.\r\n[soft music]\r\nIt's really, really pretty out here especially at night.\r\nThe garden kale and crab Rangoon that we serve\r\na sweet and sour sauce.\r\nWe get that kale from the farmer's market\r\nbut also when we can,\r\nwe get it from right here in the garden.\r\nAll of this is in the brassica family\r\nand all could be used sort of in the same recipe.\r\nSo this is sort of more like a Tuscan kale.\r\nThese are sort of wider cabbage leaves\r\nin all of which can be incorporated into the recipe.\r\nSo the crab Rangoon filling is,\r\nwe didn't wanna use cream cheese,\r\nso we make ricotta and we hang it\r\nand then we blend it until it's really, really creamy.\r\nAnd then we add the picked crab meat and chopped\r\nso that it curl to it.\r\nSo we basically just pick an ice cream scooper\r\nand we scoop it onto the lanterns,\r\nfold into a little kind of purse and we fry it.\r\nIt's like four to an order.\r\nWe serve with chopsticks and sweet zip sauce.\r\nThe rutabaga pasta, it's a really simple one.\r\nWe have this like Japanese sheeter.\r\nYou can basically turn a rutabaga\r\ninto like sheets of pasta, like lasagna.\r\nWe cut them into like these long noodles.\r\nWe just kind of cook the pasta\r\njust like you would in boiling water\r\nand then we glaze it in that butter sauce.\r\nWe just make a really simple,\r\nalmost like a beurre blanc but less acidic.\r\nAnd then we put a ton of truffles in it.\r\nAnd then we finish with a ton of Parmesan cheese\r\nto kind of have it seize up and get nice and salty.\r\nAnd then we make these like brown butter bits\r\nthat we put over the top of it for sort of crunches.\r\nIt's also very classic to serve truffles\r\nand brown butter together.\r\nSo it's heavy and noodley and tasty.\r\n[timer beeps]\r\nIt's about two o'clock.\r\nSo the cooks are gonna start slowing up soon.\r\nSo all the sous chefs and chefs\r\nthey're wrapping up their projects\r\nso that way they can make room including myself\r\nso that way the cooks can kind of spread out\r\nand do their work now.\r\nAcross in the prep kitchen they were rendering ducks,\r\nwhich they brought some of them over here.\r\nSo like, you can see like these were 14 days old.\r\nSo they're like perfectly shiny and golden brown\r\nand like not bouncy fat, like that's just,\r\nthere's nothing left.\r\nThere's just a little chip of fat on their crispy skin.\r\nI have to grab some more duck that I butchered in cleanup\r\nbut like this is all the tenderloins\r\nand this is pork butt.\r\nIt's the easiest way to make a sausage.\r\nEvery sausage recipe they're gonna say, you know,\r\nlean meat and fat.\r\nIf you just use a pork butt, it's already that ratio.\r\nAnd so you can just cut up a pork butt,\r\nwhich is a pork shoulder and grind it\r\nand make sausage out of it.\r\nAnd so we'll just do that\r\nwhile incorporating 50% duck into it.\r\nAnd then a whole bunch of like spices and herbs and garlic\r\nand all that stuff.\r\n[mincer grinding]\r\nI mean, we do duck like 10 ways\r\nbut when you get the duck entree at Olmsted,\r\nit always comes in two forms.\r\nSo like right now it's duck confit in the form of recoragu.\r\nBut often it's also duck sausage\r\nthat we can press into a quarter tray\r\nand you can steam it off.\r\nAnd then you'll have basically like a brick of sausage\r\nand you can cook it perfectly then, right?\r\nWhat we'll do is then we'll like cut diamonds\r\nor little butans or something\r\nto then like put on a grill.\r\nAnd so then we can have like a beautiful shape of a sausage\r\nwith a piece of duck breast\r\ninstead of just like always having\r\nsausage and a casing, right?\r\nIt's like a little boring.\r\nAnyways, that is a proper sausage.\r\nAnd it's nice and crispy, you see?\r\n[timer beeps]\r\nRight around four is when like everyone's culminating here.\r\nThe person that works here tonight,\r\nthey'll start setting up this how they want it.\r\nThree people will be doing the same for their station.\r\nThere'll be gathering a lot of stuff.\r\nThey'll start doing\r\nthe kind of cooking those last minute things.\r\nKind of like doing a lot of simple work too,\r\nlike knife work like chives and chop shallots and stuff.\r\nAnd at that same time\r\nis when like the dining room is being set up.\r\nYou see that Andrew, our head bartender for the restaurants\r\nis setting up the bar right now.\r\nNow is when people start to come.\r\n[upbeat music]\r\nSo people typically start and finish a meal in the garden.\r\nA lot of the snacks are like finger food\r\nor only needs a spoon and same thing with the desserts.\r\nWe do s'mores and we introduced like a hot cocktail program.\r\nSo you can have like spiked hot cocoa\r\nand you know, hot toddies and all this stuff.\r\nThe best compliment I ever received about Olmsted\r\nwas a guest said that Olmsted is like if Alinea\r\nand Blue Hill At Stone Barns had a casual baby.\r\nCasual fine dining you know, with the conscience.\r\nThanks for spending the day with me here at Olmsted.\r\nI hope you enjoyed the watching while we cook.\r\nAnd next time you're in the neighborhoods, swing by"

Hard to imagine, but Harold is ready.",
      "transcript": "Whoo. That [beeb] spicy.\r\nOh God. Yeah.\r\nTaking on takeout shawarma.\r\nLet's see what's going on here.\r\nWow. This one's hefty.\r\nAlright, so today\r\nwe're going to go look at chicken shawarma.\r\nThe word shawarma means turning.\r\nAnd that's why when you go to those restaurants,\r\nyou'll see the meat turning on a spit\r\nand it gets really nice crust on the outside\r\nand moist on the inside.\r\nShawarma could be all types of different types of meat,\r\nbut today we're doing chicken.\r\nWe're going to taste four different shawarmas\r\nfrom all over the city.\r\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and create our own\r\nperfect shawarma here in the test kitchen.\r\nFor the first one, super basic chicken, lettuce, and tomato.\r\nThis is a pretty famous place called Halal Guys.\r\nAnd everybody loves the Halal Guys. This is great stuff.\r\nThis one is served in a pita bread\r\nand then all the sauce come on the side.\r\nThis is pretty famous white sauce here. Okay.\r\nYou fight for these white sauce. All right.\r\nNow I'd like to put a little bit of the hot sauce,\r\nbut be careful because it's spicy.\r\nThat's how I remember it.\r\nThis type of chicken, I'm not really a big fan of,\r\nyou know, it's kind of big batch cooking.\r\nYou know what I mean?\r\nWe're gonna take our time\r\nand make sure we have great seasoning.\r\nTry to get as much color, as much char on my chicken.\r\nThe thing that saves this pita is,\r\nthe sauces obviously.\r\nIt's kind of a mayo-based and then the hot sauce itself.\r\nThis next one is pretty much the traditional way.\r\nVery wide open pita bread. The chicken's been marinated.\r\nThe color, the redness from paprika\r\nand chili powder, it looks like.\r\nAnd it also comes with tahini sauce on the side here.\r\nTahini is Sesame seeds has been slowly roasted and it's\r\nemulsified a little bit.\r\nElbow out.\r\nThe tahini keeps it moist.\r\nThe pickles are great. Gives it that acidity.\r\nThe tomatoes are fresh.\r\nYeah, but they use chicken breasts.\r\nI will use chicken thighs.\r\nIt stays a little bit moist\r\nand it has a little bit more deeper flavor\r\nI think, you know.\r\nOh, this one is nice.\r\nI love the pita bread on this.\r\nIt seems like it's made from scratch\r\nand the chicken has a nice char to it.\r\nI don't see any sauce. So we'll see how this tastes.\r\nMmm. They use chicken thighs.\r\nThe meat is super tender. Has more of a warm spice profile.\r\nMaybe a little bit of coriander, cumin.\r\nThat's a lot of spices in there, man.\r\nYou probably don't need the sauce\r\nreally to tell you the truth.\r\nThe pickles have a little bit of liquid in them.\r\nThat's where the moisture comes in too.\r\nBut it would be nice to put a little bit of white sauce,\r\na little bit of a red sauce on here.\r\nWoo. This is nice.\r\nI love the color of this bread right here.\r\nSee that the contrast?\r\nNow it seems like it's one of those fresh joints.\r\nYou put it on the griddle, it puffs up,\r\nyou grab it and you slice it open and then you stuff it.\r\nFits right in your hand, you can just go right into.\r\nWow. Super nice.\r\nVery tender. Chicken is seasoned really well.\r\nI see lettuce, cucumber, tomato in here\r\nand then the chicken looks like it's chicken thighs.\r\nAs part of the toppings also for a shawarma\r\nyou'll find different types of pickles.\r\nThey're like banana peppers.\r\nOh, this is fire.\r\nWow. This one, this was my favorite. Mmm.\r\nLet me get our spices first. Right?\r\nYou're going to want to use a warm spice blend\r\nto mimic a shawarma.\r\nAnd you want that nice deep red color also.\r\nSo you got to make sure paprika is in the play.\r\nYou got to use a lot of these Mediterranean spices.\r\nCumin, whole nutmeg.\r\nYes. Next we're going to go ahead\r\nand grab chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.\r\nI think it'll hold the flavor more.\r\nIt'll stay moist. And I like dark meat anyways.\r\nYogurt for our marinade, for the chicken,\r\nbut also for our sauces.\r\nThese look great, look at these great looking pita breads.\r\nAs part of the topics also for shawarma\r\nyou'll find different types of pickles,\r\nbanana peppers, yes. We need that.\r\nLet me grab a little bit of the harissa paste for spice,\r\nalso for the red sauce. All right?\r\nThe Farmer's Market came to us. No I'm just kidding.\r\nI'm going to use the Persian cubes\r\ncause I like to snap on these.\r\nSome shredded cabbage for color and flavor.\r\nI like red onions for Mediterranean dish.\r\nThere's some iceberg lettuce, a couple of lemons and\r\na couple of tomatoes for our garnish.\r\nThat's it.\r\nTo create flavor.\r\nWe need a lot of ingredients. Okay.\r\nWhat I'm going to do first\r\nis I'm going to season the chicken itself.\r\nSometimes if you season the marinade\r\nthe salt level doesn't really get into the chicken.\r\nSo I like to do this first.\r\nSo now we're going to get right into the marinade.\r\nYogurt helps to tenderize meats.\r\nIt gives it that fat that it needs.\r\nAnd when you hit it on the grill,\r\nit gives it a nice flavorful crust.\r\nAll right, dope.\r\nSo we're going to start building the spice blend.\r\nAll right. We're going to put our stuff in a spice grinder.\r\nI basically eyeball the [beep].\r\nCause that's how I cook. Right?\r\nCumin seed, cardamom. All of these kinds of warming spices.\r\nAleppo pepper.\r\nGonna give it that Mediterranean vibes.\r\nI like the flavor of all spice, but you can use cinnamon.\r\nI'm going to put a lot of sweet paprika\r\nbecause that's where that red color is going to come from.\r\nGoing into the spice blender.\r\nSmells great already.\r\nAnd add a little bit of olive oil.\r\nKind of get it loose a little bit.\r\nA little bit of lemon zest. One juice of lemon.\r\nChicken and citrus really go well together.\r\nWe're also gonna to put a little bit\r\nof that red wine vinegar in there too, for the acidity.\r\nAnd then I'm just going to micro plane\r\nthe whole nutmeg to it.\r\nAnd add a little bit of a grated garlic in here\r\nTwo fresh garlic.\r\nGarlic is a prominent flavor profile\r\nfor these types of dishes.\r\nIt's very middle Eastern to marinade meats in yogurt.\r\nWhen I do marinades, I like to do slices of onions,\r\nmix it in with the chicken and then throw on the grill.\r\nIt gives it a nice char on the onions,\r\nhave this thing married in the fridge.\r\nAnd then we'll go ahead and cook it up later on\r\nand make our shawarma.\r\nAh [beep]. Okay.\r\nWe're going to go ahead and get into our acostumar,\r\nwhich are our sauces.\r\nFirst we're going to make a yogurt garlic sauce.\r\nwhen they made it at Halal Guys,\r\nsaid some mayo-based with egg in it.\r\nSo, turn it up a notch. Yeah, there we go.\r\nI'm going to also add a little bit of lemon juice.\r\nGives it that acidity that it needs.\r\nI'm also going to dice a little bit of these cucumbers\r\njust to add a little texture.\r\nKeeps a nice and fresh. Couple of sprigs of fresh parsley.\r\nI feel like Julia Child. And there we go.\r\nI'm not 67 though.\r\nWe'll add a bit of fresh grated garlic in there.\r\nI like having the same flavor profiles throughout our dish.\r\nAnd I loosen this up a little bit.\r\nA little salt and pepper.\r\nIt's my own take on a white sauce.\r\nSo tahini is super simple,\r\nbut you want to loosen it up just a little bit\r\nwith some water.\r\nI'm gonna hit it with just a little bit of salt\r\nand a little bit of black pepper, some crushed garlic,\r\nand then a little bit of lemon juice.\r\nThat's it. It adds a nice roasted Sesame flavor to it.\r\nGarlic, lemon. Amazing.\r\nNext one we're gonna get into is our spicy sauce.\r\nHarissa usually comes in a tube\r\nor it comes in a container like this.\r\nA little bit of a tomato paste\r\njust to give it some of that body.\r\nAnd I'll loosen it up with some water.\r\nWe're going to add a little bit of lemon juice\r\nand then I'm gonna taste.\r\n[beep], [beep]\r\nYou gotta make sure you gotta use fresh veggies.\r\nIt gives it a nice balance between those warm spices.\r\nTuck your thumb in. Don't cut your finger.\r\nSometimes it doesn't grow back. Okay?\r\nThe Persian cucumber, I feel like it's a lot sturdier\r\nand has a better snap to it too.\r\nWe gonna do some tomatoes here that we have.\r\nI want to see the tomato. Okay?\r\nI don't want it to get lost.\r\nAnd then red onion. And for this one,\r\nI'm just going to slice them down the row.\r\nJust like we did for our marinade.\r\nYou wanna kind of soak these onions a little bit.\r\nIt takes that bitterness off.\r\nThat's it for fresh vegetables.\r\nThis will give the freshness that we're looking for\r\nfor the shawarma.\r\nWhat I like the most is these pickled turnips.\r\nAmazing. I wanna put a little bit of acidity\r\nin our dish today.\r\nThey've been sitting in this pickle for a minute man.\r\nThis [beep] color.\r\nOh God. Yeah. That's sour. Holy [beep].\r\nWow. No sugar at all.\r\nI'm gonna put just a little bit. Right?\r\nWe're gonna to give them a little nice dice\r\nsince they already kind of uniformly cut it for us.\r\nWow. Look at that color though. Radioactive almost.\r\nAnd then I really, really enjoy banana peppers.\r\nLet's just try it.\r\nOoh. All right.\r\nSo we're just going to pull a little bit. All right.\r\nIt looks almost alien like. Look at that thing.\r\nIt's not Starbucks kids. Don't trip.\r\nThe chicken's been marinated\r\nfor about two or three hours now.\r\nJust want to hit it,\r\njust with a little bit of salt and pepper. Okay?\r\nI'm always been taught by my chefs\r\nto make sure that you layer your seasoning.\r\nAll right. Cool.\r\nYou know, some people don't have a nice grill\r\nor broiler at their crib.\r\nSo we're going to use this handy-dandy machine.\r\nIt's called a Searzall. Is made by a guy named Dave Arnold.\r\nAnd it's basically, you can sear something\r\nat a thousand degrees in your house without burning it down.\r\nSo like this we're going to give the chicken color.\r\nTo mimic the turning\r\nand the roasting on the meat on the spit.\r\nCause we don't have one. All right.\r\nSo we're using this [beep]. Okay. You unlocked the joint.\r\nYou turn this joint on and then\r\nwhatever problems you have in your life, it's got to go.\r\nThe Searzall will take care of it. Okay?\r\n[smooth music]\r\nAll the chickens done.\r\nSo once we seared the chicken,\r\nwe're going to go ahead and put in the 400 degree oven\r\nthat will not only cook the chicken in the inside,\r\nbut it will keep it moist.\r\nOh yeah. Ooh, smell great, man.\r\nWe just gonna do a rough dice on these. Okay?\r\nWhew. Perfect cook on that.\r\nA little oil on our griddle here.\r\nAnd now we're just going to get in the griddle.\r\nJust to give it a little bit more crust\r\nand encapsulate all these flavors together.\r\nWe've got a nice pita bread. Toast this up a little bit.\r\nWe're gonna dress some of our fresh vegetables\r\na little bit. All right.\r\nA little olive oil,\r\njust to make sure that every level\r\nof our dish has seasoning.\r\nBoom, boom.\r\nWoo. Open this up and put lettuce in the bottom\r\nwith a little bit of cabbage.\r\nI'm going to hit it with the white sauce tahini.\r\nAnd just a dollop of this hot sauce. All right?\r\nPoop, poop. Our chicken.\r\nYou go back to shredded cabbage,\r\nlettuce, cucumbers, little bit of onions,\r\npickles, tomatoes.\r\nAnd what we're going to do\r\nis we're gonna add our sauces right on top. Okay?\r\nWhite sauce and my mouth is salivating.\r\nTahini, red sauce. Boom.\r\nI'm gonna finish with olive oil. All right?\r\nAnd wrap this baby up.\r\nBoom.\r\nUnkle Harold's shawarma, baby. $9.50. Maybe $10.\r\nAll right, cool.\r\nYeah. Now we have my shawarma here,\r\nand then there's the shawarma that I liked from earlier.\r\nLet's go ahead and taste them.\r\nIs a good size shawarma. Right?\r\nSomebody else made this. Doesn't have the same love.\r\nThe chicken is not caramelized like it was earlier\r\nand there's not enough cornichos in here.\r\nYou see it's all like one pickle.\r\nMaybe I'll eat from the back.\r\nYeah, it's all down here.\r\nI want to know what kind of pitta it is\r\nbecause it stays together\r\neven though I bit off on both ends.\r\nThe chicken is flavored well, really good shawarma. Awesome.\r\nMmm. What I like about my shawarma is the layers.\r\nCrunch from the cucumbers, shredded cabbage, the pickles.\r\nThere's texture but there's also acidity there.\r\nHaving three different sauces.\r\nAll those things come into play.\r\nAnd when you take a bite into something it's not monotonous\r\nand it's something you want to make again.\r\nIn the front is a little bit of acidity\r\nfrom the lemon and the yogurt.\r\nThe back end is spices. Paprika, cardamom, allspice.\r\nWow. That's a great marinade, really good marinate.\r\nBut I think whatever pita bread this is,\r\nis the best one for a shawarma.\r\nIt's structurally built.\r\nAnd this one is already like, falling apart.\r\nI would take our chicken over theirs.\r\nIt's key to give it that nice char on there,\r\ncause if you have that,\r\nit'll bring up the meat a little bit more.\r\nA lot of that mild reaction, all of that,\r\nlike charring flavor. I mean,\r\nwe could have done it in a pan, you know,\r\nand really gotten the same effect.\r\nThat was just for show man, tell you the truth.\r\nYeah. It's always good to order it.\r\nIf you don't have the time\r\nand you have the money to buy it, but making it on your own\r\ncreating techniques, taking a time to really\r\nput it together with your own hands.\r\nI think it's the best way to do it.\r\nTasty, tasty shawarma.\r\nI'll pay $14 for this, word.\r\nSo stay focused. Keep your head down.\r\nKeep grinding. I see at the top.\r\nSouth Bronx all day. Peace.\r\n[beep] So that's what I'm talking about. Watch the mic.\r\nIt's gonna [beep] burn."
