### Multi-platformðŸ“±
Flutter supports multiple platforms for developers using a single source code, however, this app will only be available for Android's Google Play Store (for now).

### SmootherðŸŒ¿
The app was created with performance in mind by adhering to best practices provided by the framework itself and personal quality standards.

### Firebase integration
Improved using Firebase [Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics), [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore). Integrating all these services has never been easier with Flutter + FirebaseðŸ”¥.
